Nor is the app itself a solution. Product teams that view UX as <em>only</em> tactical designers of screen elements miss a critical, strategic opportunity  to both increase profitable revenue and customer loyalty. </p><p>UX teams need to help companies curate the end-to-end experience. Supporting customer business requirements and curating the UX requires understanding the different users’ journeys, from consideration through adoption or purchase, use, service, and support. Only then can we design and orchestrate the total experience a customer has at every touch point.</p><p>Look, UX teams think differently, and perceive obstacles and opportunities that other disciplines don’t. Likewise, product managers and engineers perceive obstacles and opportunities that UX does not. All of our insights are critical, and that requires a three-in-a-box collaboration and decision-making framework. It also requires leveraging Design Thinking as part of that decision-making process. Tim Brown highlights in his book <em>Change by Design</em> how design thinking can transofm organizations to produce more profitable revenue, and increase innovation. Here are a couple exmaples of where my teams have brought design thinking to the triad, resulting in $100s of millions per year in incremental profitable revenue. It’s not just about designing what we’re given. It’s also about ensuring we are solving the right challenge.</p><h2>Curating the End-to-end Experience to Open a New Market: Example 1</h2><p>In this first example, my team was asked to design software used to control IP phones. An executive on a cross-business-unit council inited me to participate in meetings where we learned Sales encountered challenges selling IP telephony solutions to small businesses. Thus, my team reached out to the field and conducted research to understand the challenges Sales faced. It turns out that small businesses preferred to purchase complete solutions from resellers, who could purchase the right solution and deploy it, without the small business team having to think about technology. We learned that resellers also encountered challenges selling this solution: It took several days for resellers to deploy our telephony solution, which reduced their profit margin to zero. As a result, resellers chose to sell less technically capable solutions from competitors.</p><p>I presented these challenges to a cross-business-unit team of executives. In the end, my team took four people three months to design and build a tool that enabled resellers to set up our end-to-end solution in 15 minutes, instead of two days. It also resulted in $100 Million in sales <em>over</em> our financial goals, in just the first year.</p><p>Figure 1: Simplifying Deployment Increased Revenue by $100 Million Over Goal in the First Year Alone</p><p><img alt="UX Increasing Revenue by $100 Million over Goal in Year 1" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6b426466-d2db-4bc0-9300-b5ca5f247f2e" src="/images/Commercial-Voice.png" /></p><h2>How did We Execute the Project?</h2><p>I formed a tiger team of product managers, software developers, and hardware engineers, and we produced the design for this application in two weeks. It was nothing more than a simple branching wizard that posed a set of non-technical questions to resellers setting up the solution. The team also leveraged color-coded cables (a standard that we implemented two years earlier), and a <span >colorful </span>four-page quick-start guide to walk users through the configuration process. The total development took us almost six weeks. However, after implementing this solution as a proof-of-concept, no one business unit would own the project and take it to market. As a result, I assembled the hardware and wheeled the solution into our cross-business-unit council of senior executives. I highlighted the challenges, then depicted our new solution. As part of the process, I asked one of the executives if he would be willing–as an absolute novice–to configure the solution. After some prompting, he did, and within 15 minutes, he had successfully set up a network that enabled him to place phone calls. The result? This council agreed to take this product to market. Within two months, it was on the corporate web site.</p><p>The reality was that configuration was only part of the problem. We solved other problems, including the ordering process. It was crazy: There were over two million possible permutations of hardware and software to purchase. So, we assembled three SKUs, so resellers could quickly purhase the right solution for any small business. The point of this is not that UX solved the whole problem. We had to work cross-functionally to get it implemented. It is that by leveraging design thinking in the overall process, we were able to solve much higher-order problems than just designing tactical screens.</p><h2>Curating the End-to-end Experience to Open a New Market: Example 2</h2><p>In another example, I was asked in 1997 (remember Windows 95?) to evaluate and give recommendations to improve the usability of one of our commercial (SMB) products. Initially, executives suggested we needed just a configuration interface. However, after usability studies comparing our products to competitive products (comparative studies), we found serious bottlenecks. For the competitive product, It took only 30 minutes for a <span class="s1"><i>novice</i></span> to configure. For our product, 0% of novices could succeed, and only 50% of <span class="s1"><i>experts</i></span> could configure our products in four hours. Users encountered challenges at every touch point, including identifying the appropriate cables and connectors, connecting them to the right ports, and then configuring the device. The accessory kit included 300 pages of reference documentation that none of our users found useful. In the end, we did design an application, but we also simplified the total experience at each of these touch points, and more.</p><p>Figure 2: Configuration Wizard (Windows 95)</p><p><img alt="Configuration Wizard (Windows 95)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a08256af-b281-462e-a053-83c5b01ef9fd" src="/images/FastStep-Wizard.png" /></p><p>After implementing our recommenations, it took a novice less than 20 minutes from opening the box to surfing the Web. The SVP of the business unit said “Jim, I can’t say that our success was entirely due to your team. But, without the work your team did, we never would have been successful in this market, at least in this timeframe.” In the end, entering this market when they did earned the company more than $2 Billion per year and provided a competitive advantage for four years. In this case, the experience itself differentiated even a highly technology-driven company. UX and design thinking can differentiate your company, if you have the right leader who understands how to partner with other disciplines to curate the total experience.</p><p>Figure 3: Open Me First Bag, Color-coded Cables, and Quick Start Guide</p><p><img alt="Open Me First Bag with Color Coded Cables" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8d02eeac-abaa-4d8c-ab3d-61416b59e972" src="/images/Accessory-Kit.png" /></p><p>The reality is that if a company leverages UX <span class="s1"><i>just</i></span> to design and build application screens, it’s not the team’s fault. They need a UX leader who can help the company understand the opportunity, and then help define a repeatable process that results in great design, and a design-thinking culture. They can make alot of money with the right UX leader at the strategy table. Questions? Give me a call, as always!</p>',

                'body' => '<p>Mass exposure to instant, elegant apps has driven users of every demographic to expect simple, elegant, even edgy apps. The explosion of mobile applications has produced an expectation for simplicity and elegance in design across products, whether consumer or commercial. Without question, UX teams cannot get away with typical IT-level designs any more (but really, should they ever have?).</p><p>In the Consumer Travel UX Design Studios, designing simple and elegant apps for mobile required we clarify our focus and simplify the experience in ways we would not have considered had we designed for the desktop first. Luke Wroblewski identified the term “Mobile First,” but our team stumbled on it experientially. We found that designing for mobile first brought us a laser focus for us to simplify the experience, to reveal only the core function of their product.</p><p>Let’s take an example: Email in a mobile versus a desktop context. In a mobile context, we typically just read and send terse messages- we have very targeted interactions. Contrast that with the desktop, where we have access to significantly more functionality, including filters, calendar, notes or memos and more. In the mobile context though, each function focuses on a very targeted interaction: For example, Email is one app. Calendar is another. Memos or notes is yet another. We are in fact seeing that mobile apps that used to contain multiple functions have been stripped apart into multiple apps.</p><p><img alt="Mobile versus desktop device characteristics" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f335084c-ef80-4574-a95a-90c88769ead9" src="/images/Device-Characteristics.png" class="align-left" /></p><p><br /> </p><p>In fact, the recognition that mobile apps need to be hyper-focused on their core purpose is leading teams to produce multiple single-purpose mobile applications, instead of large, monolithic applications that reveal capabilities based on the user role. LinkedIn for example is building seven separate mobile apps, including one for consuming content (LinkedIn Pulse), a Job Seeker app, a recruiter app, and so on. The reality is that building multiple applications for different purposes can actually be much easier than building a single role-based application. Role-based applications with large amounts of functionality that change what is presented to the user based on their role requires much greater effort than just building separate apps.</p><p>Until recently, most teams designed and built their traditional desktop applications first, then crafted their mobile experiences as an add-on. Today, good UX leaders recognize how to take the insights we gain designing for mobile first back to our designs for the desktop. The converse is not true. Going from desktop to mobile in most cases requires completely rethinking the purpose of the mobile capability. And, designing for mobile first drives my teams and me to think in new and creative ways that drive innovative concepts and gestures we might not have considered otherwise.</p><p>Now, there are two situations where I might recommend building web-based applications as opposed to a dedicated app. For example, apps that will only be accessed one time on a mobile device, and content portals, work great as responsive web apps that run on the mobile device.</p><h2>In-flight Entertainment App- An Example</h2><p>Thus, in considering new solutions for airlines and cruise lines, our UX Studio moved to design for handheld first. In the cases I’m going to highlight, the mobile venue was based on hardware we sold: Android- and Windows 8-based tablet apps. For the reasons mentioned, we decided to design the following applications for handheld first. We found that the apps needed to be:</p><ul><li>simple or minimalist</li><li>usable</li><li>delightful</li></ul><p>Here’s an example of an in-flight entertainment application we designed and developed for airlines:</p><p><img alt="In-flight entertainment application" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="23a62c03-828e-4242-9d5a-903197131ff5" src="/images/IFE-Composite.png" /></p><p>In this example, we kept each screen simple, so it included only the essential elements. We also allowed content to be king. That is, we did not want the UI elements to interfere with key user tasks. We also worked to ensure a clear visual hierarchy, so the users’ eye could easily pick out the item that mattered to them most, based on the task they had to perform. Here are additional screen examples of each main category of the application:</p><p> </p><h2>Movies</h2><h2><img alt="In-flight entertainment app showing Movies section" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="500f5e2d-5db1-4fad-9800-a2084b40e04f" src="/images/IFE-Movies.png" class="align-left" /></h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Games</h2><h2><img alt="In-flight entertainment app showing Games section" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="965cbb10-fd85-43cc-9400-e55abbe36162" src="/images/IFE-Games.png" class="align-left" /></h2><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Merchandising</h2><h2><img alt="In-flight entertainment app showing Merchandising section" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cec95678-0b0f-48bc-8a00-aca635da0d26" src="/images/IFE-Merch.png" class="align-left" /></h2><p> </p><h2>Publications</h2><h2><img alt="In-flight entertainment app showing Movies section" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="19075e93-fab4-4dcf-9700-d178b05195b1" src="/images/IFE-Publications.png" class="align-left" /></h2><h2>Making Each Application Brandable</h2><p>We also worked to make each application completely customizable (white-labelable) to any given airline brand, as shown in this application created for the cabin crew (flight attendants. These screens leveraged the “infinite horizontal scroll” model created for Windows 8. We also created a design language that enabled us to craft hybrid applications (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), and with only 15% additional work, to produce designs for Android or iOS applications as well.</p><p><img alt="Blue, Yellow, and Purple versions of In-flight Entertainment app" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="28114e16-0292-418f-963c-6047ebfa314a" src="/images/Cabin-Crew-White-Label.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>The purpose of this app was to enable the cabin crew to:</p><ul><li>recognize and reward loyal and high-value customers</li><li>sell merchandise with ease</li><li>access information about other crew members flying with them, as well as forms, manuals, and training materials</li></ul><p>Here’s a view of the main screen of the application, as seen on the device:</p><p><img alt="Home screen and infinite scroll for cabin-crew app" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="680930e9-3d6d-4a96-ba63-99cdf64658a2" src="/images/Crew-whole-app.png" class="align-left" /></p><p>Here’s an example of our Mobile Concierge (airline check-in) application:</p><p><img alt="Mobile check-in application with infinite scroll" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="05eb839e-1aad-424a-915c-9221739d8645" src="/images/Check-In-Composite.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Here is that same application branded for a different carrier:</p><p><img alt="Mobile check-in application branded red" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="da666c43-6434-483c-8907-7dcfd3a412bd" src="/images/CheckIn-Red-Composite.png" class="align-left" /></p><h2>Cruise-line Application</h2><p>In one case, we created a cruise-line <span >concept</span> application, which was intended to open the sales pipeline for additional travel channels. My team had learned through user research that at the time, most cruise lines still handed paper brochures highlighting activities, merchandise, and tours to passengers on their cruises. Our team envisioned passengers entering their state room and finding a tablet with an application on it that shows the family\'s entire itinerary. The guest could look at activities by date, book reservations (on board or off-board), add them to their travel calendar, and even have individualized and family calendars for families. When we created this application, cruise lines made no ancillary revenue when passengers booked–let\'s say–a jet ski rental in Mazatlan. On the other hand, if a passenger booked a jet ski rental from onboard the ship using the cruise line app, the cruise line would generate incremental ancillary revenue. </p><p>In the end, the passenger could also take pictures with the mobile device, and have them added automatically to a scrapbook that connects to an onine scrapbooking application, enabling the guests to record their trip in a scrapbook forever. Or, passengers could load the cruise-line application on their own mobile device before the trip and reserve activities and events even before the trip started. The goal was to both engage passengers, and increase monetization for the cruise line.  </p><p><img alt="Mobile Cruise-line application" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7a9fb975-80a3-4ee2-b505-5bee66fd00d4" src="/images/Cruise-1.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Itinerary page for Cruise-line App:</p><p><img alt="Itinerary Page for Mobile Cruise Line Application" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9828152a-6254-44d0-b800-d7f6a3829fff" src="/images/Cruise-2.png" class="align-left" /></p><p>We also produced a large number of additional applications, both consumer, and agent-facing.

They first define a vision for the experience outcome they intend for their users and customers. Only then do they define features and technologies to support this vision. They create a positive emotional engagement, so customers love it!</p><p>So many companies start with lists of features, but have very little vision of what the outcome will be for customers. An Experience Outcome vision doesn\'t just list a feature. It highlights the experience a user will have with the feature. I talk with people every day who say they built all the features their customers asked for, but Sales teams could not sell the product. Let\'s take an example-- voicemail. If you have a feature on a list that says "Voicemail," engineers will build it so you have to dial a phone number, wait for the system to answer, listen for 45 seconds to the prompts, enter the proper password and key sequence to get into voice mail, and press the right key sequence to listen to and dismiss each message, in sequence. However, if the Product Manager\'s objective was to make the process simple, they would have failed. Instead, if you can show everyone on the team what you want to accomplish, they will find a way to do it. For example, you show them a list of voicemail messages, and let them tap one to play it, and they understand the experience outcome you are trying to accomplish. Visualization helps bring your concept to life, so everyone understands your intent. Here is an example of a simple set of visualizations we did to highlight a new product concept.</p><h2>NDC TripAway Prototype</h2><p>In the following visualization, the user goes into an app (we created both a Desktop and a Mobile version).</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Home Screen for NDC TripAway Concept Visualization" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fe1ca1c1-3d48-45f0-a40c-1270b6d49811" src="/images/1.%20LoginPage.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>The traveler says he needs to travel to LA for a 6-day workshop in LA that starts the following Monday. Note that today, a traveler must search for flights, transportation to and from the airport, hotels, car rentals in separate searches. In fact, the average traveler looks at 16 different online sites, just to book a single trip. Our concept for the TripAway application would enable a traveler to pick up a mobile phone and speak in natural language into their phone, and have the system automatically identify all of the different modes of travel we just highlighted.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Search Results Page for the NDC TripAway app" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b0cded43-f606-4d9d-9c08-8ce34e8aadc6" src="/images/2.%20Search_Results.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>In this example, you can see that the sytem returned three complete itineraries:</p><ul><li>Cheapest, which would cost the traveler (or their company) less money, but would be less convenient and take the traveler longer</li><li>Fastest, which is also the most expensive</li><li>Balanced, which is the best combination of travel time (and convenience) and cost</li></ul><p>The traveler chooses Fastest, for two reasons: First, his travel schedule is squeezed between arriving home from another trip, and the fact that he cannot be late to the workshop Monay morning. Second, the incremenal cost of the faster trip is small, which makes the convenience acceptable within corporate travel guidelines.</p><p>When the traveler clicked on the Flight fro the list on the left, it brought up additional flight options.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Fastest trip, with options for flight and other travel modalities" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="723b5674-3fd8-401f-9e00-d1be67f4b5a6" src="/images/3.%20Modify_Flights.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>He ended up choosing a different (cheaper) flight, and decided to add an in-flight alcoholic beverage to the cost of the flight.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Viewing the list of possible alcoholic beverages" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4fedb378-8f9b-4f97-bf20-322cecb1debb" src="/images/4.%20Add_Services.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>From the list, he chose a Sangria, because the description sounded so interesting, and the picture looked so enticing.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="The Traveler Selects Sangria from the list, and it shows a description" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d967eeb3-48e2-4901-b625-37f13c55af90" src="/images/5.%20SelectPssenger_Service.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>The system then brings up the form of payment. He choosed payment from the methods of payment that he had previously stored, and clicks Pay.</p><img alt="Selecting the form of payment" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c661a386-d9a2-4f8d-bb00-e51dbe6f0949" src="/images/6.%20Add_Paymet.png" class="align-center" /><p> </p><p>In the end, he could have amended any of the travel options, but this prototype, which took 4 days to create, helps visualize the final outcome and experience. This represents only one of several pieces to the total product and experience, but it highlights how defining an Experience Outcome up front, with visualizations, and descriptions from the Product Manager, can drive a clear outcome. Of course, developing this system would require significant effort, because of the complexity on the back-end. At this point however, the Engineering team could identify the technology requirements to meet the objective in the visualization, and the PM could craft detailed requirements. In the end though, the team can see they\'re looking to produce the equivalent of Visual Voicemail, not the old style voicemail systems of the 1990s. Visualizing experience outcomes helps drive differentiation.</p><p> </p>',

Typically, travelers spend up to five hours across 16 different websites to book the optimal trip. In this case, Candice just speaks her request into the system. Travel Buddy books her travel, and presents options for her to consider. She chooses one, and within five minutes, receives an itinerary.</p><p><img alt="Candice requests an itinerary from Travel Buddy" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0d74b872-3d63-4b1a-8300-bb87c7c2e8ec" src="/images/Candice-3.png" /></p><h2>Screen 3, Candice is Automatically Rebooked and Notified</h2><p>In this screen, we recognize that typically, a flight cancellation results in the user not knowing about the cancellation until after they arrive at the airport, at which point, they often work frantically on their phone and working with customer service agents to get rebooked. At that point, they must wait, often for many hours, for the new flight to be assigned. Travel Buddy eliminates all this hassle by automatically rebooking not just the flight, but the Limo as well. All Candice knows is that she doesn\'t have to leave for an additional two hours. "Cool" she thinks.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Candice is Automatically Rebooked" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7293e242-1e4f-47e6-b100-e94e8ea66c8f" src="/images/Candice-4.png" /></p><h2>Screen 4, Card- and Cashless Transaction with Limo, and Travel Buddy Converts to Audio</h2><p>In this screen, we highlight two important capabilities. First, when Candice arrives at the airport in her limo, her payment is handled automatically, because her credit card is on file (we identified this before Uber and Lyft). Thus, she doesn\'t need to fumble around for cash or a credit card, wait for a receipt, and have to calculate a tip- it\'s handled automatically for her. Second, Travel Buddy converts to Audio mode, so it can give her directions through her Bluetooth headset to check in for her flight inside the airport. It also shows turn-by-turn directions on her Smart Watch.</p><p><img alt="Travel Buddy Converts to Audio Mode" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="286a251e-c920-46a0-8b00-d4c9a3a6aa17" src="/images/Candice-5.png" /></p><h2>Screen 5, Travel Buddy Gives Audio Directions Inside the Airport and on Smart Watch</h2><p>Candice easily finds her way to the Baggage counter because of the step-by-step directions. She arrives at the baggage counter, and instead of having to wait in line anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, a Mobile Concierge greets Candice. She taps her Smart Watch to the Concierge\'s tablet, and her profile and itinerary come up automatically for the agent. He is able to offer her upgrades to Business (for a fee), or offer her other amenities. He then taps Candice\'s watch, and transfers both her bag tags and boarding pass to her electronically.</p><p><img alt="Candice being checked in by a mobile concierge" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b6799a67-97db-4bd3-8200-0d90a4069c9f" src="/images/Candice-6.png" /></p><h2>Screen 6, Candice is Guided to the Precheck Line and Speeds Through</h2><p>Because Travel Buddy knows Candice has Global Entry status, it guides her to the TSA Precheck line, where she speeds through. She just scans the boarding pass that automatically appears on her watch, and shows her ID.</p><p><img alt="Candice at the TSA Precheck Line, scanning the boarding pass on her smart watch" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a89ae1fd-b6b9-49a9-ac00-a402ee0beb30" src="/images/Candice-7.png" /></p><h2>Screen 7, Candice is Guided to Shopping, then to the Executive Lounge</h2><p>After Candice got through Security, Travel Buddy checked her preferences and noticed from previous behaviors and from her preferences that she likes to shop once she\'s through security. The location-based system notices where she is currently, and asks her if she would like to shop or go to the Executive Lounge. She selects Shopping, so Travel Buddy shows her stores nearby where she might like to shop. It can also include discounts and other offers that these stores would like to present to travelers.</p><p>Travel Buddy also has a link for "Executive Lounge." After she\'s done shopping, she taps this link, and Travel Buddy guides her to the lounge. </p><h2><img alt="Candice, being directed to shopping, then to the exec lounge on her smart watch" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="17cb9944-ad41-49da-b500-e47e9a7f064c" src="/images/Candice-8.png" /></h2><h2>Screen 8, Candice Automatically Gets into the Executive Club, and Watches a Movie</h2><p><span >When Travel Buddy registers that Candice is within 20 feet, it changes automatically to show a QR Code, which she scans at the Executive Lounge to confirm her membership.</span></p><p><span >Once inside, Travel Buddy reminds her that she can watch In-flight Entertainment while in the executive lounge on her personal electronic device (PED). She debates whether to work or watch a movie, but decides that she wants to start watching a movie.</span></p><p><span ><img alt="Candice enjoying airline-provided entertainment on her P.E.D." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="35e6e6cf-00e3-4b92-9d00-a44954c20209" src="/images/Candice-9.png" /></span></p><h2>Screen 9, Candice is Directed to Her Flight and Continues Watching Her Movie</h2><p><span >Fifteen minutes before she is supposed to board, Travel Buddy notifies Candice that it is time to pack up and head to the gate (Travel Buddy knows the gate is a 7-minute walk from the executive lounge).</span></p><p><span >Candice gets on the flight, and once she is seated, she resumes watching the movie she had started in the lounge. The flight attendant notices on her Cabin Crew PED that Candice is a top-tier customer, and likes to have a bowl of warm mixed nuts and a champagne when she sits down. So, the flight attendant offers Candice these items. </span></p><p><span >At this point, Candice\'s experience is that the process has been not only smooth, but truly enjoyable and relaxing. Without a doubt, she will choose this airline again in the future.</span></p><p><span >Candice receives a notification based on he preferences that there are items on sale in the in-flight catalog. She pauses the movie, and decides to shop online. She finds a set of cool Solar LED lights for her backyard and purchases them on board. </span></p><p>The benefit here is that Candice is satisfied, and is presented with relevant offers. The result is that the airline earns a revenue share of all merchandise sold from their site. Airlines have paper-thin margins today, and increasing merchandising opportunities is a key way to increase margins.</p><p><img alt="Candice sitting on the plane, receives a free meal, and shops online" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="477bacc1-aa2b-4032-9248-721d4abd08ff" src="/images/Candice-10.png" /></p><h2>Screen 10, Buddy Provides Social and Behavioral Recommendations. Candice Buys a Gift</h2><p>Travel Buddy knows Candice is traveling to New York, and that it\'s her friend Janice\'s birthday. Travel Buddy also highlights items from Janice\'s Amazon Wishlist, so Candice purchases a gift, which is waiting for her at the gate when she lands.</p><p>Candice does a little work while sitting on the plane, then at 30 minutes before the flight ends, she decides to watch another movie. She knows that she will not finish it, but knows she will be able to watch it later that evening at her hotel, because she was granted digital rights to the movie for 24 hours when she ordered it on her PED.</p><p><img alt="Social recommendations to purchase gift for friend Janice" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a67f2d0c-0c39-44f0-ac58-88deb57e8cf2" src="/images/Candice-11.png" /></p><h2>Screen 11, In NY, Travel Buddy Guides Candice at Each Step and Notifies Her When She Has an Upcoming Travel Activity</h2><p>Once the plane lands, Candice is notified where to pick up the gift she purchased for her friend Janice, where her baggage claim is, where to pick up her rental car, and where her hotel is. Travel Buddy also notifies Janice whenever she has an upcoming travel activity, such as leaving for the airport 3 hours, 15 minutes before her flight, so she can return her car, and be on time for her flight.</p><p>Travel Buddy becomes her indispensable single travel concierge that increases her loyalty, as measured in customer satisfaction scores, and her delight throughout her travel experience.</p><p><img alt="Candice Arrives.

                'body' => '<p>Leaders of Engineering and Product Management organizations often feel the need to stimulate rapid innovation, and the emotional buy-in of initiatives by their teams. As Eric Ries suggests in <em>The Lean Startup</em>, companies that can pivot the fastest to changing market needs are the most successful. Corporate leaders want to be able to do just that: Identify ways they can pivot their product or service strategy, and align teams around these new directions rapidly, so they can execute a change.</p><p>On the other hand, corporate User Experience teams often feel that they have big ideas that could differentiate their company, if only they could get somebody to listen, if only they could get “a seat at the table.” The challenge is that UX teams often do not have a vehicle to constructively drive relevant and innovative ideas into time-pressure-based roadmaps.</p><p>Many of the most successful companies have defined a tool that solves both of these challenges—Rapid Design Labs. Rapid Design Labs facilitate multidisciplinary teams to identify transformative new ideas that enable companies to evolve or pivot, and ensure teams are emotionally bought into the ideas and vision. </p><p> </p><p><img alt="Group of participants in a Rapid Design Lab" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a409696c-3022-479a-9709-09600cdb55f3" src="/images/RapidDesignLabs-Group.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Also called innovation workshops and deep-dive workshops, Rapid Design Labs were first codified at IDEO by David Kelley and his team in the late 1990s. Today, virtually every design agency offers its own unique flavor of innovation workshop. Such workshops are based on the concept of design-thinking, which is essentially a user-centered design process.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Basic Design-thinking process diagram" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="506bc547-aef1-4a80-a64b-755a48785700" src="/images/Design-Thinking-Diagram.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, Rapid Design Labs leverage two key elements: First, they include a place to present all relevant data, including market data, customer experience challenges and data, as well as user research. Second, they include user validation of concepts, to ensure the product or service will create an emotional connection, and that customers will buy it. They enable teams to accomplish innovation and alignment that it would typically take six months or more to achieve. They enable teams to identify great new ideas, and craft a clear vision of the outcome that will best meat customer goals, and goals set by the executive team. In this model, the team rapidly ideates, prototypes, and validates increasingly high fidelity concepts until they get it right. At the end, they have a buildable product that customers will buy and users love.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="New process for cutting learning cycles" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e0c0ea09-3fd7-4d0c-812b-43a11dc81ece" src="/images/Concept-to-Code.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>A Process In Brief</h3><p>Rapid design labs are multi-day collaborative workshops where teams work together to solve major business problems. Teams review challenges, leverage intensive brainstorming and structured ideation exercises, engage in exercises to converge and validate ideas, and align organizations around these ideas. In design labs, designers, engineers, product managers, and often users engage in purposeful play, collaborative design, rapid prototyping, and user testing. </p><p><img alt="Composite of several design lab pictures" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f68d02c4-e655-4250-9b05-5c5de8c3309b" src="/images/RDL-Composite-1280.png" class="align-left" /></p><h3> </h3><h3>High-level Benefits of Rapid Design Labs</h3><p>Rapid Design Labs provide four basic value points. They enable:</p><ul><li><strong>Rapid Innovation</strong>. Design labs are often also called Innovation Workshops. I have a version that I call Future Think Labs, which enable teams to recognize technology and market trends, and leapfrog them to envision the future and converge on the core set of big ideas that can create a competitive advantage for many years.</li><li><strong>Cross-functional synthesis</strong>. Design labs solve pressing problems in a matter of days that can take many months—or even years—to solve otherwise. These workshops apply integrative thinking at the organizational level. In essence, experts in different disciplines (engineering, product management, and user experience) all perceive the world differently, including opportunities and constraints. Moreover, corporate culture rewards each discipline trying to push their opinion as the right one. Without all key stakeholders though, one cannot build products that differentiate, are marketable, and technically feasible. We need to leverage the best possible insights from each field. Design labs help synthesize different insights across disciplines.</li><li><strong>Deep accelerated dialogue</strong>. A big obstacle to innovation is the surface-level dialogue in most organizations, fragmented across meetings, email, and PowerPoint presentations. Design labs enable deeper dialogue. They bring teams together to solve problems in a shared space, which when facilitated properly by an experienced leader builds trust. Common goals ensure the teams must show productive output when they emerge from their multi-day event. Recognizing the need for progress, participants in design labs understand one another’s perspectives and constraints and are able to identify solutions that acknowledge these constraints. These solutions are never watered-down versions of the ideal that everybody is willing to accept. Rather, they are the best possible solution. The right facilitator ensures emotional buy-in from all participants, and that solutions are powerful.</li><li><strong>Pivoting through lean design</strong>. In <em>The Lean Startup</em>, Eric Ries argues that the runway for any new product or company is defined by how many times it can successfully pivot itself—change direction—to deliver real customer value. Design labs are the perfect tool for lean design: They permit fast, cheap, objective pivots.</li></ul><p>I have been conducting Rapid Design Labs since 2000 to define transformative new product ideas and align cross-functional teams around these ideas rapidly. Here are just two examples.</p><h2>Design Lab Examples</h2><h2>Example 1: Transforming Search Marketing</h2><p>In the first example, I arrived to lead a UX team after the organization had built a keyword search marketing web app that had significant challenges, both from a business, and a design standpoint: 57% of users who had already created a search marketing campaign in the past could not successfully book another campaign, because the tool was too complex; we had a 94% drop-off rate for customers who had already indicated <em>intent</em> to begin a keyword search marketing campaign. That is <em>not </em>a 6% conversion. That’s a 6% conversion for that subset of users who <em>already expressed intent</em> to start a search marketing campaign! Among the challenges? Overall, users were given a forced flow that did not make sense to them, or progressively enable them to achieve small successes. The product had numerous features that virtually no users took advantage of, but having these features significantly increased complexity of the app. The visual design was very poor, in that there was virtually no visual hierarchy among seemingly random elements on the page. More than that, elements moved from page to page, and the flow changed, depending on the task the user performed. All in all, it was a seriously flawed product.</p><p>Unfortunately, Product owners and other stakeholders had far too much attachment to the decisions they had made about the product to-date. (This is why, in my opinion, senior leaders should be rotated through roles every few years, so they do not stay attached to decisions—even poor ones—made years earlier.) Rather than try to push with no hope for successful change in the organization, I got agreement from the Senior VP of the organization to lead a Rapid Design Lab. In this design lab, product management, engineering, marketing, and design convened to identify a solution, within very strict political parameters.</p><p><img alt="Picture of participants in a design lab" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8c314760-d706-49d6-b501-1b33bad3ad53" src="/images/Yodel-Pics-blurred-combined.png" class="align-left" /></p><p>In the end, because the existing product had so many challenges, we found a path to success by defining a new product. Product Management agreed that we could create a much more focused, simpler desktop-based product to meet a use case that would help us monetize at a much higher rate. This ideation and definition process represented the first two days of the workshop.</p><p>Over the next two days, we sketched the new product right in the design lab, identified the core and differentiating capabilities, and then tested paper prototypes with users. On the last day of this five-day rapid design lab, each stakeholder agreed to a set of tasks that their organization would complete to drive the product forward.</p><p>It is important to note that leading up to this design lab, stakeholders from different groups seldom collaborated, and competed in unhealthy ways. During the rapid design lab, they came together and solved a big problem to produce a series of successes they had previously not experienced. Not only did each person in the design lab have emotional attachment to the new idea, but the design lab increased trust, candor, and collaboration among stakeholders. In the end, each individual took action to convince his or her executive staff. Each organization felt that the new idea arose organically from within their team, and thus they felt motivated to ensure its success. When we work together to solve real problems, organizations not only support the new concepts, but defend them on an emotional level.</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Sketches from a rapid design lab" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="35ccfcda-6024-4798-9b28-409d5d54e0d5" src="/images/Sketches-combined.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>In the end, after deciding to build this product, we formed a very small team of approximately eight core members that worked in an Agile model and produced the new desktop search marketing product six months later. Note that as a comparison, the main product took over a hundred engineers three years to build. The result was that 95% of users—even novices—could successfully create a new search marketing campaign on the first attempt. From a revenue standpoint, we saw a 16% uplift in the first month this product was available.</p><p>Here is a picture of the new application in its most complex state:</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Screen shot of YSM Desktop" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="50eec6e3-f943-4bb2-9b00-f6a6058fb882" src="/images/YSMD_ALL.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><h2> </h2><h2>Example 2: Driving Organizational Alignment and Buy-In; A CEO-level Initiative</h2><p>When I arrived to lead an Advertising Products UX team, predecessors in my organization had build a new ad publishing tool. Unfortunately, Sales people in our own organization refused to use the product. The Senior VP of the Product organization and the Senior VP of the Sales organization jointly attended a meeting with the CEO to discuss the Sales team adopting it. The Senior VP of Sales argued that nobody asked them what they needed. The Senior VP of Product argued that Sales did not want to provide input, and just complained. In the end, the CEO told these two S-VPs that they had one year to get the Sales team using the new platform, or they would both be fired! I approached S-VP of the Product organization (my S-VP) and asked him to let me lead a Rapid Design Lab to bring the teams together around a common vision. He agreed. Honestly, nobody else seemed eager to get in the middle of this emotional issue. It is true that such high stakes present risk, but in that risk arises opportunity to rise the tide for all organizations as well. In this case, I recognized the value of Rapid Design Labs, and had successfully brought teams together before using this method.</p><p>As part of the process, I formed an executive steering committee to which I could report on progress daily, to ensure complete and constructive participation. In this case though, the high stakes also promoted strong opinions and emotions.</p><p>In the end, in this Rapid Design Lab, we decided on a new design that reduced the number of pages with which users needed to interact. They were originally forced through a sequence of screens where they performed a single task on each screen. The problem was twofold: First, they had no context from screen to screen, so often had to go back to see what they had entered previously, and then return to a subsequent screen. Second, this forced process did not let them experiment, which they needed to be able to do several times before completing their workflow. During the design lab, we took the original sequence of 15 screens down to a single workspace, where users could modify all of the different values, and see the results in real-time in one location. It sped the process and provided much-needed flexibility.</p><h3>Old GUI Flow- More than 15 Pages, Loss of Context</h3><p><img alt="Advertising Publishing system- complex flow" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d122780c-c6ce-4739-b807-7be0f6fe0c53" src="/images/Apt-1_0.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>We also identified how to ensure the product was highly performant and scalable with large data sets, which we did. One week later, we had an interactive prototype based on our designs from the design lab. A week later, a sales representative presented the interactive prototype to the S-VP of Product and Sales and said “this is what we want.” Because Engineering participated, they agreed they could build it. And, the Product team agreed that the new version of the product would also sell much better externally.</p><p>More importantly, in the next year, the Sales organization had adopted the product, and we highlighted a win to the press. The S-VP of Sales said “My team is thrilled with the relationship we’ve built with your organization. Coming together in the [design labs] made my Sales team feel heard and empowered for the first time. I’m giving you a thumbs-up on your plans. I like it that we can go back to the CEO with a positive story.”</p><h3>New Single-Page Configuration Workspace</h3><p><img alt="Advertiser Publisher Tool, After- Single Page Workspace" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5532c3ba-5e0a-4ddc-944d-77ed94e092e0" src="/images/Apt-2.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Pivot Your Business Quickly with Rapid Design Labs</h2><p>The best companies are able to define ideas that can disrupt an industry quickly, and get their entire team aligned around and excited about the new concepts. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to identify a breakthrough idea or transformative design rapidly. As challenging this can be though, it can be more challenging getting teams focused and aligned to get them to market. Innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking, and teams need to be emotionally invested in them before they accept them, even if they are disruptive innovations that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. Rapid Design Labs represent a new tool that many design firms and good leaders within product and service companies are leveraging today. They provide a framework for their teams, then ensure teams work together in Rapid Design Labs to define specific product requirements, designs, and technologies.</p><p> </p>',

With this consumer vacation site, the goal was to increase engagement and conversion. The challenge was an infrastructure that didn’t support modern interactions. Rather than deliver sub-standard designs, we helped drive business process and engineering changes required to implement each enhancement. <span style="line-height:1.5">Some of these changes included upgrading to a different back-end technology, and implementing some client-side capabilities to improve site performance and page load times. By creating a more modern and responsive site, we were able to</span> promote user engagement, which increased demand. It also increased satisfaction for property owners, enabling us to increase the number of properties. Of course, funding constraints typically exist in startups, so many changes have had to wait.</p><p>Figure 1: Original Site Design Versus Initial Redesign</p><p><img alt="Original versus New Site Design" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3f69902e-9a5e-4702-a237-55e01c287eb2" src="/images/AOV-Old-n-New.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>We also drove technology changes to ensure users can view and interact with key information and page attributes almost instantly after a search, while the remainder of the content on the page continues to load. In the end, our work resulted in a roadmap of capabilities and innovations that will take several releases to implement, and which leverage leading design concepts and patterns.</p><p>Among changes were a new logo, which we curated for under $1,000, a brand and design refresh, and several mechanisms for driving engagement. </p><p>Among these mechanisms for driving engagement were:</p><ul><li>High quality photography, which can increase engagemen by as much as 4x</li><li>Create an inspiring design that is easy to use, and meets the deeper needs of the users booking properties.</li><li>Support the four major intents users have when coming to such a site:<ul><li class="p3">Find a property in a pre-determined region</li><li>Seek inspiration to find the right vacation destination (see the Future Home Page option later).</li><li>Find a way to help the Chief Household Officer make a choice of venue that everybody (across families) would love. The fact is that when choosing vacation rental homes, often more than one family travels together, and making everyone happy can be a chore.</li><li>Find special deals</li></ul></li><li>Enable direct booking of properties, rather than simply sending an email and waiting for a reply.</li><li>Enable users to enter the address of a destination, and find properties in that vicinity.</li><li>For mobile users, to identify where they are, and identify and book properties with availability for the current night.</li><li>Create the equivalent of favorites and wish lists, so travelers can both track inspirations and share them socially.</li></ul><p>As part of this process, we compared other sites, both direct competitors and related travel sites, to understand what they do well, and what we could do to improve the consumer site, both from a supply (property owner) and demand (traveler) perspective. We also conducted primary and secondary research to understand the personas for the site and product. In the end, we identified that by far the larger percentage of visitors was women, and specifically women who fit into the category of Chief Household Officer. That is, they are in charge of a household, and for booking vacation plans not only for their family, but often for multiple families at once.</p><p>Figure 2: Alternate Design, which Tested Worse with Female Users</p><p><img alt="Alternate Design Tested Worse with Female Users" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9e7d0b22-7eae-4c97-b707-7b1d41c074e9" src="/images/AOV-Alternate.png" /></p><p> </p><p>It turns out that most male users preferred the white space and smaller images found in Figure 2. However, most females preferred an image that covered most, if not all of the Home page, with content over the top of the image. Thus, over time, the company intends to include even higher quality photography, and even leverage multiple images, with movement and sound, embedded within CSS. Figure 3 highlights the intended new page, though we are recommending a full-page picture.</p><p>Figure 3: Eventual New Home Page</p><p><img alt="Intended redesign over time" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="29b7cd4b-11cc-4c6f-8200-df3af1903163" src="/images/AOV-Home-Just-Top.png" class="align-left" /></p><p>While the current site is a significant improvement over the previous version of the site, any site—consumer or otherwise—requires constant tweaking to improve. In fact, data has shown that instituting a multivariate testing (a/b testing or bucket testing) infrastructure can help increase engagement and conversion by 500%. In the end, the Engineering team will implement such an infrastructure, but first must continue to implement “do or die” features. Such an experimentation framework is critical for consumer sites, and I look forward to working with a great group of people in this company going forward to help implement many of the enhancements that come out of our engagement.</p><p>Figure 4: Inceasing Engagement for Users Who Want to Explore the World (Initial Concept)</p><p><img alt="Enabling Customers to Explore the World" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2e206255-0867-4a86-9a00-0dd97edbcf2d" src="/images/Explore_page_1.png" class="align-left" /></p><h2> </h2><h2>Comparing Search Results Pages- Old Versus New</h2><p>Here is an example of the old versus the new Search Results (Geography) pages:</p><p>Figure 5: New Search Results (Geo) Pages</p><p><img alt="Old Versus New Search Results Page for a City or Region" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="67e31ca7-037a-4e90-b100-bc2013ec3ca0" src="/images/AOV-Geo-Page-old-n-new.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Comparing Property Pages- Old Versus New</h2><p>Here is an example of the individual property pages from the old versus the new site:</p><p>Figure 6: Old Versus New Property Pages</p><p><img alt="Property Page Before and After Redesign" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1b8b3a9c-3dc0-4ebc-8605-5bc920e26bf8" src="/images/AOV-Old-n-new-Property-Page.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Photo View Results Page</h2><p>Here is an example of the new Photo view results, which shows the Information bar pinned to top of page, so that it is never lost when the user scrolls down the page:</p><p>Figure 7: Search Results Page in Photo (Card) View </p><p><img alt="Photo view results with Information Bar pinned to top of page" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6aee1de0-36f9-4cde-9800-cfc7cc85edca" src="/images/Photo-View-Results.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Key Results</h2><p>Since the redesign, the site has increased its supply of properties, and acquired another 400,000 through property management companies.

Of course, this one consumer site functions as a reference implementation to prove the real-time booking and distribution capabilities.</p><p>This article has shown only a subset of pages for this redesign.

You do not want to look at these factors in isolation, nor do you want to get locked into a single form factor. Our goal was to ensure scalability across multiple form factors, and to enable the visual design to be adapted to different brands. The next four screens summarize how we approached each of these three factors.</p><p><img alt="Three factors we considered in our visual design" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bbc67671-9949-43de-b805-5b925efcb757" src="/images/VisD-2.png" /></p><h2>Factor 1, Form Factor</h2><p><img alt="Considering the form factor for a visual design" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f0672a78-84cd-4fdb-9600-baf5b79324f3" src="/images/VisD-3.png" /></p><h2>Factor 2: Understanding the user’s conceptual model, and identifying the right UI paradigm</h2><p><img alt="Understanding the user\'s conceptual model" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d51ad358-e19d-40a5-9e4e-78a1ba75acc9" src="/images/VisD-4.png" /></p><h2>Factor 3: Visual Design Language</h2><p><img alt="Defining a visual design language" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="295bb796-66ee-4c47-b600-a3bfd580d932" src="/images/VisD-5.png" /></p><h2>Defining a Visual Language for Need- Versus Want-based Applications</h2><p>In considering how to approach this application visual design exercise, we had to evaluate the differences between “need” based applications, and contrast thos with “want” based applications. In the end, we need our users to form an emotional connection with the product, to feel that it makes their lives easier, makes them look and feel both cool and highly competent. Just designing your typical application look and feel no longer suffices. The application has to delight, and solve the business problem in the optimal way.</p><p><img alt="Factors in defining a visual language for need-based versus want-based applications" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2c150888-19d0-4ba4-9304-044bf084a71b" src="/images/VisD-6.png" /></p><h2>Want-based Applications</h2><p><img alt="Defining a visual language for want-based applications" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="20f4cfe5-6c81-4791-9100-ee9ac93c8777" src="/images/VisD-7.png" /></p><h2>Need-based Applications</h2><p><img alt="Defining a visual language for need-based applications" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="102c2699-e6f3-4270-9300-db7f812a23b8" src="/images/VisD-8.png" /></p><h2>Primary and Secondary Research and Insights</h2><p>As we considered the visual design language for this set of applications, we leveraged lean ethnography to gather data rapidly. For more insights about this process, refer to my article <span class="s1"><i>User Research and Visualization in the Lean UX World</i></span>. As we gathered these insights about the user’s mental model, we were able to form the basis for an Interaction Model, which binds an app together so it supports the conceptual models of its target users. It ensures users are always oriented and that they can predict how to take actions to achieve their goals. For more information about IxD modelling,  refer to my article about defining an interaction model for a family of products. </p><h2>Primary Research</h2><p><img alt="Primary research to inform our visual design language" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="347c2079-fbe5-4aca-a408-8acf037102b2" src="/images/VisD-9.png" /></p><h2>Secondary Research</h2><p><img alt="Secondary research in defining our visual design language" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b04e2369-2c41-458e-9c00-d959f1357f4c" src="/images/VisD-10.png" /></p><h2>Key Observations</h2><p><img alt="Key observations from primary user research and secondary user research" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="da461ec3-3312-4c6a-8400-a8b2d8d75635" src="/images/VisD-11.png" /></p><h2>Key Considerations from User Research</h2><p><img alt="Key considerations from primary user research and secondary user research" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="31bdabc7-7257-4b54-832d-45b954ade415" src="/images/VisD-12.png" /></p><h2>Moodboards Prepared to Evaluate Visual Design Concepts</h2><p>Moodboards highlight a team’s inspirations for the tone, identity, personality, and language that defines a visual style. In some cases, as in this example, we simply look at inspirations that support our primary and secondary research. In other cases, we might explore different aspects of tone, identity, personality, and language. The team would create exploration statement, such as “What if Apple designed an enterprise application,” “What if Frank Gehry designed a business dashboard,” or “What if Porshe designed a reporting tool?” As we explore the identity, our mood boards might show mash ups based on these exploration statements.</p><p>For personality, the team might agree on a set of personality types (such as “The Innovator,” “The Architect,” or “Sports Car.” Designers would then ideate on traits of each of these personality types. For example, the innovator might have these traits: Inspirational, ambitious, simple, consistent, future thinking, flawless, clean. The sports car might have thest traits: Fast, contemporary, fun, sexy, proud, envious. </p><p>We then expore different abstractions from the mood boards, including shapes and colors, then review different iterations. We then select an iteration, and show it in a final design, as in the screens that follow. </p><p><img alt="Moodboards to explore visual design concepts" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1944879c-b018-41cd-b248-726521dae955" src="/images/VisD-13.png" /></p><h2>Concept Abstractions</h2><p>Based on the factors highlighted in the mood boards, the team defined some concept abstractions.</p><p><img alt="Abstractions from mood boards" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8fa5a7ec-93b9-4e0c-9400-ef3a04169e6a" src="/images/VisD-14.png" /></p><h2>Shape abstractions from mood boards</h2><p>The team explored three shape abstractions that appeared in the mood boards.</p><h3> Shape Abstractions- Option 1</h3><p><img alt="Shape abstractions from mood boards- Option 1" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4f6a0bfa-64ce-40d5-9a2d-456af7a00213" src="/images/VisD-15.png" /></p><h3>Shape Abstractions- Option 2</h3><p><img alt="Shape abstractions from mood board- Option 2" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8d881cd3-ed00-49aa-ab00-c57c71398ad7" src="/images/VisD-16.png" /></p><h3>Shape Abstractions from Mood Board- Option 3</h3><p><img alt="Shape abstractions from mood board- Option 3" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6004e3d6-a650-4a66-8d02-2cf55a022619" src="/images/VisD-17.png" /></p><h2>Color Abstractions from Mood Boards</h2><p>One of our goals with this exercise was to look at sample airline websites.

They rapidly identify unmet user needs, and emotional connectors to a product or service. They ensure the product is intuitive, satisfying, and delightful. I call this model my Logical-Emotional Experience Paradigm, a term similar to what Tim Parsey, former VP of UX at Yahoo articulated back in 2011. More recently Kelly Goto, a tremendously gifted researcher and leader of an agency that cares deeply about developing products that users love, codified this model even more clearly. Following this model, researchers and designers create experiences that create a positive engagement for their users. At the same time, they support users in completing real objectives efficiently.</p><p>Figure 1: Jim\'s Logical Emotional Design Paradigm</p><p><img alt="Jim\'s Logical Emotional Design Paradigm" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="683f1b16-051a-4d68-8700-cb7196592597" src="/images/Log-Emot-Experience.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2> </h2><h2>Lean Ethnography- What Is It?</h2><p>Recently when talking with a User Research leader who I respect deeply, I said tongue-in-cheek that I will probably never hire another <span class="s1"><i>traditional</i></span> user researcher. To my surprise, she agreed! Don’t get me wrong. UX teams need to understand user needs, and ultimately to find the key emotional connectors to your product. The reality though is that we can draw on the framework of lean processes and rapid contextual research to engage in Lean Ethnography.  </p><p>The reality is that having the right features that are usable is just foundational. We also need to understand the factors that drive a positive or negative emotional connection to our products.</p><h2>Finding Logical, Emotional Drivers</h2><p>User research has to identify the logical and the emotional drivers of users’ connections to a product and brand. People cannot often express why they are emotionally connected to something. They just love it or they hate it. If we can meet users’ deeper emotional needs, they will defend our products beyond logic. You may be familiar with the phrase (attributed widely to Mark Twain) “You cannot displace, through logical argumentation, a position that was arrived at emotionally.” We want people to defend us emotionally, and logically. What one company can you think of that customers support beyond any rational position? That is a company whose profits will continue to soar.</p><p>The question then is whether we can create products that are easy to use, but also beautiful, that feel fantastic to touch and use. Can we have products that are intuitive, satisfying, and delightful? We can, and it doesn’t need to take months.</p><p>I love the way Samsung conducted research into how they could connect on a deeper emotional level to their users, so they would love the new Samsung Galaxy III and later phones. In the end, the Galaxy rivals the iPhone for market share, so the research paid off.</p><h2>Lean Ethnography- A Case Study</h2><p>The issue here is that Lean for design and engineering needs to mean lean for UX Research as well. UX Researchers need to find new ways to gather the right data fast. Saying “sorry, we can’t respond with data in the next two weeks 10 days, because the research will take 3 months minimum” is seldom the right answer.There are cases when it should take this long, but they are increasingly rare. Some researchers will say “Jim, you don’t get it,” and I’m completely OK with that. We won’t work together. Let me share an example.</p><p>Last year, this very issue arose: I prompted my team to think up the next generation device user experience for their delivery service drivers in seven days. Now, the researchers on the project told me it would take at least a month to conduct the user research to provide data to inform a high-quality vignette. We just didn’t have a month. We had a couple days to gather research and five work days to prepare our solution. Rather than walk away, we did some guerilla research: We ordered several pick-ups and deliveries from a delivery service in a two-day period. We observed the drivers, and asked numerous questions, so we could very rapidly understand their context of use, their current challenges, their goals, both explicit and implicit, and what connects them emotionally to their current process, good and bad. In doing so, we were able to create the vignette, or visual story, highlighting a new mobile solution in five days. As part of our research, we learned about the drivers’ conscious goals, and their unconscious goals, their obvious challenges, and their unstated challenges. </p><p>In the following vignettes, we highlight the recommended solution, as well as some of the key emotional motivators for these delivery drivers. After creating this visualization, we then work with the engineering team to define what is technically feasible. So, rather than the technology being defined first, we envision the solution first, then define how we can achieve this vision.

                'body' => '<p>To inspire and engage internal stakeholders, and align cross-functional teams around a common vision of our users, I innovated with our personas. In producing the definitive set of personas, though we created buzz and aligned cross-functional teams, using action figures stirred controversy in the UX field. I decided it was more important to establish a dialog about what innovation really is and think outside the typical box, rather than follow the traditional UX path.</p><p>My UX team had a deep understanding of both conscious and unconscious needs of our users, but also needed to make personas sticky (memorable) for product teams. Before our personas, different product teams used their own personas, which were not based on user research, because nobody had presented personas in a highly professional fashion up to that point. We also noticed that in this particular corporate culture, many engineers collected action figures, such as Captain America, and so on.</p><p>At the same time, working in a corporation takes an emotional toll on a team over time, and I wanted to reinvigorate energy and creativity among my UX team. Thus, I decided to use action figures to represent our personas. As I mentioned, doing so also stirred up controversy within the UX field, as purist researchers felt that personas <em>must</em> be represented by a human photo to create empathy. Interestingly, I found no research that proved we cannot empathize with a non-human character (action figure). In fact, I found research suggesting we may be able to empathize just as much. What\'s more, we found empathy with our non-human personas to be just as high, but <span class="s1"><em>much</em></span> more importantly, we achieved our stated goal—that product teams <span class="s1"><em>recollected</em></span> and <span class="s1"><em>recognized</em></span> our personas and their characteristics much more than if they were not presented in unique and interesting ways. We got their attention, and they loved it!</p><p>Figure 1: Eagle-Eye Edward, a Reseller Persona</p><p><img alt="Eagle-Eye Ed Reseller Persona" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d4b5998c-3a27-41f1-bb1a-26a0f3698f0e" src="/images/EagleEyeEd.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>We even created pop-ups for each persona, and created a poster saying “Collect All Seven!” Shortly thereafter, we found engineers bartering for different pop-up action figures, and several had the whole set on their desks.</p><p>Moreover, the UX team won an award for innovation presented by vice presidents from across the company for having developed these personas. </p><p>The lesson in this effort is <span class="s1"><i>not</i></span> that we should or should not use human personas or action figures. It is that when innovating, you have to step out of the box that says “this is the way everyone agrees it should be done (so don’t be different!).”</p><h2>How We Defined and Created These Personas</h2><p>To craft each persona we of course gathered significant research to understand user characteristics, business objectives, priorities, likes, dislikes, and insights or product considerations. We then defined example physical charactersistics of each persona, based on actual people in the roles that the persona represented. We also identified key accessories they carry with them. For exmple, we highlighted the types of clothes they might wear, the type of briefcase they might carry, the type of cup or mobile phone they might carry, and so on. We then had these personas built as action figures (yeah, dolls), along with these accessories, leveraging a company we worked with in China.</p><p>Figure 2: Example Accessories Used to Define a Persona</p><p><img alt="Example Accessories Used to Define a Persona" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="433bfe9b-ce14-4de9-9100-bc2323b837f8" src="/images/Ed-Accessories.png" class="align-left" /></p><p>We then did photo shoots and Photo-shopped the action figures into typical scenarios, within environments where we might typically find them. </p><p>Fig 3: Example Photo Shoot- Sales Meeting</p><p><img alt="Ed Presenting In A Sales Meeting" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="69a291a4-6248-4d3c-a922-347b3a10f715" src="/images/Ed-Photo-Shoot-1.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Fig 4: Photo Shoot- Working with Expert</p><img alt="Photo Shoot- Working with Expert" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="34f06063-2019-4e17-9c00-bb30766d4fb0" src="/images/Ed-Photo-Shoot-2.png" class="align-center" /><p>Fig 5: Photo Shoot- Driving</p><p><img alt="Photo Shoot- Driving" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d1086fe9-5c50-4a53-9405-5d19e5ff09b9" src="/images/Ed-Driving.png" class="align-right" /></p><p> </p><h2>Lessons</h2><p>When people say “you don’t understand; you can’t do it that way,” you need to consider valid concerns, but then find the best way to work around those concerns and drive hard to your larger goal. By nature, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking, which means you need to drop old ways of thinking and operating. Several "experts" criticized our personas, saying that by showing our customers as dolls, we did not respect them. Quite the contrary: We polled numerous customers, and most of them saw the humor in representing users as action figures. Several even thought we should take it farther and represent them as <em>Action Heroes</em>, with capes and disguises! Rather, I found that in the UX industry, we have a large number of purists who articulate how things should be, and others line up behind them, fearful of trying anything new. In the end, should we use non-human characters to represent personas? Honestly, I am not attached to representing them in any way. The key here is that these personas representations engaged product teams in a dialog about users in a way human characters had not to that point. They created a stickiness, and ensured that product teams developed solutions based on having internalized the characteristics of these archetypical users.</p><p>Figure 6: Concept Artwork for a Three-fold Popup, Using Multitasking Millie</p><p><img alt="Multitasking Millie- Popup Concept" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ce14e19c-8339-44da-800b-114c50e0e11c" src="/images/Millie-Horiz-Popup.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>In the end, the benefits of this effort were manifold. First, Engineering embraced the concept and engaged with the personas, designing products around these users’ needs. But also, executives got excited about User Experience in ways they had never previously been. For example, as the company was establishing cross-company Councils to break down silos, executive sponsors invited me to work with them to understand their customers, and how to increase our traction with customers. This effort in fact led to two specific initiatives, where the UX group was able to redesign experiences that led to more than $100 Million in revenue above goal. It also led to the Chief Marketing Officer working with me and my team, and to updating the corporate tagline from a technology tagline, to a tagline that put humans at the center of the technology equation. Here are examples of a couple additional marketing artifacts we used to build excitement for these personas.</p><p>Figure 7: Persona Pop-up, Front and Back</p><p><img alt="Persona Pop-up, Front and Back" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0b5f2779-366f-45fa-af2b-43c59863b1d2" src="/images/Millie-Front-n-Back.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Figure 8: Internal Persona Marketing Poster- Choose The Right Persona!</p><p><img alt="Persona Marketing Persona" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="78e79bd9-819f-4112-a700-b0f9e7c6808d" src="/images/Personas-Sumry-Postr.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Figure 9: Internal Persona Marketing Tool: Collect All 7!</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Internal Persona Marketing Poster- Collect All 7!" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d32c0ddd-6ea2-402b-aa00-fbcf5feb8739" src="/images/Collect-all-7_0.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>The Value of Persona-based Design</h2><p>This would not be a complete discussion of personas without highlighting the value of persona-based design. Since Cooper wrote the book <span class="s1"><i>The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</i></span> back in the early 1990’s, different organizations have begun leveraging personas in different ways, for different purposes. Having said this, a Marketing persona is different from a persona used for design and development. A dev-based persona is an archetypical representation of up to three of the target users for your product. You include key attributes and attitudes, both conscious and unconscious, but only as they relate to the use of your product, site, or the products sold on your site. The persona details have to highlight possible attractors and challenges. What are the persona’s likes, loves, dislikes, challenges, and hates. In my Logical-Emotional design model, we need to design to support user tasks, but also understand how to connect with the user emotionally. For example, what makes them feel cool, or what gives them a deeper sense of meaning? For example, what can you do to make your users the center of attention socially? What can you do to empower your users, to make them appear to be the most intelligent users of products like yours in you domain? So, go document via personas both these process-centered design parameters (how to optimize for user success), as well as emotional connectors. If you do, you will have captured both the logical and the emotional drivers for your product, and your users will defend your solution to the death!</p><p>Several books have also emerged that highlight the negative aspects of persona-based design when leveraged improperly. For example, Phil Terry in his book <em>Customers Included</em> suggests that personas are not useful for design. I agree with his larger point, that his Listening Labs are also valuable, because they provide insights into real user needs. However, when scaling across multiple developers, teams, and projects, persona-based design can be extremely valuable. Yes, teams need to include only useful information in persona definitions. For example, I\'ve seen personas for digital designs that include the persona\'s height. Useful? Not a chance, unless you\'re designing something physical, like a pair of pants or a cockpit for a car or airplane. But, if you have the right UX leader driving your team, they can make sure you have the right persona attributes, and that the designs differentiate! </p>',

                'body' => '<p>In the article “Lean UX: Reduce Learning from Six Months to Two Weeks,” I highlighted how great UX leaders know how to research and build concepts fast, solicit feedback, and iterate. They create presentation-layer code in days or a couple weeks. They then gather insights from users in usability studies (both performance- and preference-based data), and get market-based feedback to ensure customers will buy the product. If the product has challenges, they iterate. By moving fast from concept to code, they reduce the learning cycle from months to days, and know they have a great product from the start, one that users love and are willing to buy. This article takes the wireframe vignettes (story) presented in the article “Wireframes Tell a Story” and presents the functional prototype that my team produced, based on cross-functional input and feedback. The screens in this article became the basis of the final product. We took this presentation-layer code (<em>View</em> layer in the MVC model) and connected it to the business layer (<em>Controller</em> layer), then to the back-end. Users and customers could interact with what felt like a real application. As such, we were able to both validate the concept in the marketplace, and validate the usability of our design throughout the design and development process.</p><p><img alt="Flow diagram, sketch, wireframe, and final app" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4d3a2134-7f44-4e71-a804-4ad70194c099" src="/images/Flow-to-Prototype_0.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p>When done right, producing the View layer takes 10% of the work required to build the full application. Let’s take the analogy of a spear: The presentation (view) layer is the tip. It looks good, but without the handle (the application back-end) to give it weight, balance, and the right trajectory, the tip makes no real impact. You need both the tip and the handle, and both require skill. One challenge with UX is that product managers and engineers often confuse the lesser amount of work with lower complexity and therefore a reduced skill set. Because they understand features and technology, they over-simplify the process of defining the experience outcome upfront, and over-think the features and technology too early in the process. But, as Steve Jobs said “You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.” The view or presentation-layer represents the final experience. Start with this result, with the intended experience outcome, map it through the presentation layer, <em>then</em> define technology and features to support the result. That is what we did with in the following example.</p><h2>The Application</h2><p>In this example, the screens represent exactly what a user would see in the final application.</p><h2>Visual Design</h2><p>Let’s start with the visual design—we had several goals; take a look at the screen below as you review these goals:</p><ul><li>Content is king: Remove any lines or extraneous elements that are not absolutely essential to helping the user find the element they need to interact with to perform a task. If there is an extra line, dot, color, grouping, or element, remove it.</li><li>Honest and simple: Remove unnecessary skewmorphisms, because these draw the eye to the style, rather than content.</li><li>Flat: Even back in 2012 when we developed this application, when Apple and Microsoft were still using gradients, we implemented a flat design. Fundamentally, gradients draw the eye to themselves unnecessarily.</li><li>Clear visual hierarchy: It is clear to the user when they first encounter this page what the key elements are, and where to look for what kinds of information. Moreover, the hierarchy, or relationship between elements is clear, and group elements that are all part of a larger context.</li><li>Progressively build to complexity where required: There are times when workflows are inherently complex, even after you simplify them as much as possible. When this happens, start simple, and add elements over time, so the user gets used to the baseline, and then sees only the necessary incremental elements. Cognitively, start with what the user knows, and build on that.</li><li>Maintain context. Ensure the user is always oriented, even if they have multiple sessions and multiple tasks going at once. If the user looks away and comes back, make it easy to see the point of focus within two seconds.</li><li>White-labelable: Make sure the colors and logos in this application can be easily replaced with other brands, so we could sell this application to multiple customers, and easily customize it to each.</li></ul><p><img alt="Home Screen" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="079ab92c-4d64-437f-8b00-b28d180704b9" src="/images/ResGUI-1.png" /></p><p> </p><h2>Application flow</h2><p>The following sections highlight the application flow for a single scenario- a customer Judy Meyer, who is a Gold Tier customer with FlyAway Airlines. Judy has different needs when she flies for business versus when she flies with her family for leisure. The system allows the agent to select the appropriate profile quickly, which auto-populates the appropriate fields with the correct parameters. Of course, the agent can still change these parameters if the passenger chooses.</p><h2>Judy Meyer Calls the Reservation Center</h2><p>In the screen above, you can see that the reservation’s agent is on the phone with a customer, Ms Judy Meyer.</p><h2>Reservation Agent Selects Profile and Destination</h2><p>In the following screen, the res agent (Chris Childress) has selected Leisure Travel Preferences for Ms Meyer, who indicated that she wants to take a family trip (with her husband and daughter). Because the system stores both business and leisure travel preferences, when the agent selected Leisure, it automatically selected the class of service “Premium Economy” and because their dates are typically a bit more flexible, the system will check for flights two days before and two days after the target dates, to provide flexibility. Had Ms Meyer said she was on a business trip, her preferences would have given her Business Class by default, and would only find flights on the exact date provided, because her business schedule is typically inflexible. These were Ms Meyer’s preferences, and they are changeable in preferences. They could also be overridden by the agent booking the trip, but tended to speed the process of booking.</p><p>Note also that the agent selected Round-trip, a starting point of PHL, and a destination of LHR, plus 2 adults and one child.</p><p><img alt="Searching for flight" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="171fe38b-e34b-4b3f-8e05-5c770c76b463" src="/images/ResGUI-2.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Search Results Screen</h2><p>In the Search Results screen, we changed it to show the top breadcrumb <em>Search Travel </em>highlighted. We also wanted to retain the user’s context:</p><ul><li>We summarized their original search parameters inside of a collapsed container, which they could change</li><li>We showed each result inside of a container that could be minimized if the agent wanted to see an overview of multiple legs of a trip at once (especially useful on complex itineraries)</li></ul><p>The screen shows all options for each leg of the trip. Note that if the agent hovered over any class of service for a trip, an overlay appeared, showing the price.</p><p><img alt="Search Results" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d4453f97-e1bc-454b-aa04-4e9951bf70aa" src="/images/ResGUI-3.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Selecting a Flight and Having it Show Up in Order Summary</h2><p>In this screen, the agent selects a flight, and the system shows the total cost of the items selected thus far.</p><p><img alt="Selecting a flight" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8c616a7e-2c36-4063-ae27-39381ed05b61" src="/images/ResGUI-4.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Selecting a Return Flight</h2><p>In this screen, the agent selects the Return flight, and that shows up in the Order Summary on the right. This follows the initial concept that screens become more complex one item at a time as the user progresses through the work flow. In addition, the left of the screen, shows all active orders, with the current order highlighted. In terms of visual hierarchy, you can see that Chris Childress is waiting on Ms Judy Meyer, and is creating a trip with booking reference REQYYD.</p><p><img alt="Selecting Return Flight" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="59fb3b31-26be-4a7e-9804-4c5eafe54d9f" src="/images/ResGUI-5.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Confirming Passengers and Seating</h2><p>In the previous screen, the agent had clicked either Book, or clicked directly on the Customers breadcrumb, either of which would take them to this screen.</p><p>In this screen, Chris Childress verifies that the people traveling with Judy are Jack Meyer and Rebeccah Meyer. Because they were listed in her Leisure profile, they were automatically added. Of course, Chris could remove either or both with a single click, or add a different passenger. She clicks either the Next button at the bottom of the screen, or the Services breadcrumb at the top.</p><p><img alt="Adding Passengers" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0da10cb1-89fb-4b16-8651-8158f6bf8121" src="/images/ResGUI-6.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><h2>Adding a Tablet Rental</h2><p>Because airlines need to earn incremental revenue through add-on merchandise and services, Chris asks Judy if she wants to rent a tablet on which they have games for kids, along with music and the latest movies, for her daughter.

                'body' => '<p>When I joined HP to lead the UX Studios for Consumer Travel, my goal was to design products that transform the future of travel. Unfortunately, I had to throw existing designs away and start from scratch. Why? Existing designs did not follow a cohesive interaction model- a design model that binds an app together so it supports the conceptual models of its target users. It ensures users are always oriented and that they can predict how to take actions to achieve their goals.</p><p>Initially, the application screens were all based on a single master page template, which meant that every design had to fit within a specific structure, regardless of task. Moreover, the application was broken into tabs, such that any given role had to select a tab to have access to their tasks. Unfortunately, tabs did not offer a logical or parallel structure. Such a navigational model could work fine for an informational site, but not for an application that needs to make airline agents efficient. Finally, to adhere to the master templates, designers had to nest key functionality two layers deep, which in most cases made no sense. The fact is that different users had a very different conceptual model of the tasks they needed to perform.</p><p>Figure 1: Master Page Template- An Example of Poor Design</p><p><img alt="Initial Master Page Template (An Example of Poor Design)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3ce46978-8c7e-4425-a751-81708c96774f" src="/images/Initial-Jetstream-Master-Pages.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p>However, we needed to identify the conceptual model for each user, and craft an interaction model for the app that supported these conceptual models. Let’s step back and address some key questions:</p><ul><li>Why can’t a team just use a master page template for their designs?</li><li>What is a conceptual model and an interaction model?</li><li>What did our interaction model look like?</li></ul><h2>Why Not Use Master Page Templates?</h2><p>I often hear people—even experienced designers—suggest that they can quickly create a global template or an information architecture, and then begin designing. Now, if they’re designing the simplest of Web portals, they may be right. Global templates are akin to style guides that strictly enforce exactly where every element goes—not just on one page or screen, but across many of them. Style guides and UI standards and style guides can actually reduce the likelihood of producing great design. As Jared Spool highlighted at SXSW 2011 in his presentation “Rule-based Decisions versus Informed Decisions,” UI standards and guidelines are essentially rules that teams must follow regardless.</p><p>The challenge with rule-based design is that it fails on any exception cases. Of course, design is all about solving real problems (where exceptions are the rule!). Style guides do not work to promote great design, because every design is by definition different. Every design solves a different problem, and therefore should have a different solution. Unfortunately, business leaders often ask me to create style guides, and we have known way too many designers who still believe that producing and following style guides can deliver great design. Here is another example of where we differ as an industry, and need to start coming together with a single answer. It’s a black-and-white case: Style guides are bad. Pattern libraries, when implemented correctly though, can enhance the quality of design. An interaction model, on the other hand, is more like a design pattern and design principles that describe the ways in which objects relate, with many sub-patterns that together describe the model. The difference is that interaction models leave room for designers to solve users’ real problems, which is in fact the very purpose of Interaction Design.</p><h2>What is a Conceptual Model and an Interaction Model?</h2><p> </p><p>A conceptual model represents the mental framework from which a user approaches a task or goal. We can see conceptual models in action when we consider a few Microsoft Office products:</p><ul><li>Microsoft Word reflects and supports the conceptual model of a person who inserted a piece of paper into a typewriter in portrait mode. The user can simply type and produce an artifact, such as a letter. Of course, they have a significant amount of value-added features.</li><li>Microsoft PowerPoint on the other hand, supports the conceptual model of a person who wrote on a clear plastic sheet—typically in landscape mode—and set it on top of an overhead projector. Of course, PowerPoint also has additional value-added features.</li><li>Microsoft Excel supports the conceptual model of an accountant working with rows of entries and columns of numbers. Again, Excel also has additional value-added features.</li></ul><p >Figure 2: Example Conceptual Models for Different Airline Agents</p><p><img alt="Example Conceptual Model for Airline Agents" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3de5ef43-20ad-499f-a140-641842fed155" src="/images/IxD-Model-3.png" class="align-left" /></p><p >The interaction model (IxD Model) for each of these applications differs in the right way—to support the conceptual model of users performing different tasks. </p><p >Thus, these concepts are highly practical, though they might at first seem unnecessarily cerebral. If you don’t understand a user’s conceptual model, you can’t define an IxD model that supports and enhances their experience. At times, we invent new ways of interacting, but more commonly, new interactions reflect real-world interactions. Even the swipe to unlock model follows a natural affordance.</p><h2 >What Did Our IxD Model and IxD Guide Look Like?</h2><p >Note that we created an 11” x 17” booklet that we could hand to customers, developers, product managers, and anyone else who needed to understand our customers’ mental framework for approaching their tasks, and the UX architecture we would follow to support their tasks in the most natural way. Here’s one page from our 110-page IxD Guide, highlighting the basic Interaction Model for this family of products:</p><p >Figure 3: Basic Interaction Model for a Family of Products</p><p><img alt="Basic Interaction Model for a Family of Travel Products" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="996bf07c-503d-42a9-bf00-cc691e9726a8" src="/images/IxD-Model-1.png" class="align-left" /></p><p >An interaction model then defines how all of the objects and actions that are part of an application interrelate in ways that mirror and support real-life user interactions. It ensures that users always stay oriented and understand how to move from place to place to find information or perform tasks. It provides a common vision for a portal or an application (desktop or mobile), including the types of attributes that are appropriate for each.</p><p>It enables designers, developers, and stakeholders to understand and explain how users move from objects to actions within a system. Defining the right interaction model is a foundational requirement for any digital system and contributes to a cohesive, overall UX architecture. </p><p>The interaction model is something that users internalize, but probably could not articulate—and wouldn’t care whether they could. Users internalize well-constructed interaction models, which make most actions within a system more predictable. Just as the book <em>The Invisible Computer</em> suggests, we often don’t notice a product or application when it works well. Clearly, then, there is no one-size-fits-all interaction model. Every product solves a different set of problems for different users, and therefore, requires a model that, as much as possible, reflects and supports their real-world interactions. Therefore, just as we defined the users\' conceptual models, we also identified the top goals for the interaction design.</p><p>Figure 4: Example Interaction Design Goals</p><p><img alt="Interaction Design Goals" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a691d385-f3ed-4bfa-8000-d94b617cd86c" src="/images/IxD-Model-2.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>An interaction model also describes the types of affordances to present in the application. For example, should a PC-based (non-mobile) application use more Web-portal affordances or desktop-application affordances? In our case, we decided to start with mobile first, to help bring focus and prioritize capabilities. But, even when moving from mobile to desktop, we don’t leverage the design exactly as presented on the mobile. On a mobile device, we have what we call guided mode, which includes only the key capabilities required to support a focused mobile experience. In Desktop applications, we leverage the entire desktop in more of a palette mode. </p><p>Figure 5: Types of Interactions Define the Types of Affordances</p><p><img alt="Types of Interactions Define Affordance Types" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cc2adb85-4906-496d-8900-c4ad1fe69f2b" src="/images/IxD-Model-7.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Take email for example. On the desktop, in addition to reading messages, you can set rules, view calendars, notes, contacts, and tasks. On a mobile device (particularly a phone, which is the predominant mobile device used) we typically read and respond to email, but do less setting up of rules, organizing mailboxes, and so on. Therefore, the mobile email client can (and should) be more focused. However, they can follow the same basic interaction model, and should, to ensure the applications are predictable (not consistent, but predictable) across devices.</p><p>Figure 6: Device Characteristics</p><p><img alt="Device Characteristics" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b6eca7b8-b447-47dd-ab00-0bf24695245b" src="/images/IxD-Model-8.png" class="align-left" /></p><p>Thus, for our travel applications, we decided that even our Web applications would use only application affordances. At the simplest level, it would minimize use of underlined links and use more buttons. It would have a Maximize/Restore button that eliminates or restores the browser chrome, enabling the application to take up 100% of the usable space on the screen, similar to that on Cooliris, for example.</p><p>I have seen many UX teams with significant design skill craft applications that were not consistent in their affordances. Should they leverage web portal affordances? Web app affordances? Desktop affordances? Mobile affordances? The upshot for us was that, though we were designing the technology to be highly performant, for our web-app version of the product, we chose a desktop application metaphor. At times, it doesn’t matter what model you choose so much as just choosing a model and sticking with it.</p><p>How, then, do you define an application’s interaction model? It can take months, but in the end, when stakeholders look at the model, they typically say, “Of course! I get it! It’s simple!” In this way, defining an interaction model is not unlike complex mathematics. You expend effort to figure it out, but once you understand the model, it seems so simple, and you wonder why it took so long to understand it in the first place.</p><p>Defining our interaction model for consumer travel products took me a few months of user observations to understand how users conceptualized their goals. I also internalized how they thought about objects supporting those goals, and the actions they performed using those objects to achieve their goals. On this particular project, we’re designing consumer user interfaces for mobile, tablet, and the Web, as well airline agent user interfaces for the Web and tablet.</p><p>When focusing on agent interactions, we recognized that each type of agent had a different primary object for which they needed to solve problems. As we saw in the first image of the conceptual model, reservation agents taking calls to book a new flight or change an existing flight are focused on a customer who is on the phone. They need to solve problems for customers, such as booking a flight or changing a profile.</p><p>On the other hand, gate agents at an airport have a different goal, which they call closing a flight, and, thus, a different primary object on which they focus. Their supervisors measure their performance based on their ability to close flights, or get their flights away from the gate on time. Gate agents have several activities going on at the same time—all with a focus on getting a flight away from the gate on time. They need to make sure the passengers all have seats, award some upgrades, accommodate those on a waiting list either on the current or a later flight, and so on, but all of these activities are in service of closing a flight. Most of the gate agents I have observed care deeply about serving their customers—even if we don’t recognize it— but their continued employment depends on their getting flights away from the gate on time.</p><p>Here is how we translated the conceptual model into an IxD Model:</p><p>Figure 7: Basic Foundation of Our Interaction Model</p><p><img alt="Foundation of Our Interaction Model" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="583a07bc-5c56-440a-af48-72853ba0ecac" src="/images/IxD-Model-5.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Here is an example of how the interaction model applies to a Reservations Agent.</p><p>Figure 8: Example of an Interaction Model for a Reservations Agent</p><p><img alt="Example of an Interaction Model for a Reservations Agent" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7fbd30f9-720a-492d-ac14-202baaf7d7bf" src="/images/IxD-Model-6.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>In the end, designers were able to easily internalize the design patterns required to design a highly usable, useful, and delightful application for each user. In addition, the IxD Guide helped engineers and product managers also internalize and articulate how the application worked or needed to be assembled to support different users’ goals. In other articles, I highlight specific screens in greater detail, including the workflow for different user roles, as well as branding for different airlines and third-party travel companies.

The same is true for UX teams. We have to research and build concepts fast, solicit feedback and iterate. By moving fast from concept to code, we reduce the learning cycle from months to days, and we know we have a great product from the start that users love and are willing to buy.</p><p>With today’s interactive and gesture-based screen elements and responsive designs, the only way to truly evaluate an experience is to touch what feels like the real UI. Static screens just can’t impart the tactile experience of a real product or application. My UX and Innovation Studio leveraged a parallel experimentation framework to rapidly produce high quality prototypes, which provided two significant benefits. The first was that we could try new interactions and iterate rapidly. The second was that we could solicit user insights rapidly to identify whether our experiences connected with people in a meaningful way. Developing prototypes on which we get feedback, instead of waiting until the product is complete, reduces the feedback and learning cycle from months or years to just ten days for a typical product.</p><p>Figure 1: Concept to Code: Reducing Learning Cycles from Six Months to Ten Days</p><p><img alt="Concept to Code: Reducing Learning Cycles from Six Months to Ten Days" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="51d07110-d7be-4804-b800-db2617c625a7" src="/images/Concept-to-Code_1.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Seldom can a design survive the scrutiny of user feedback without iteration. Our designs are more successful when we can rapidly visualize our concept, get a prototype in front of users (and buyers), take feedback, and iterate. We have to fail fast and iterate. But let me be clear: We generate prototypes to solicit feedback not only about usability. We do so to answer another key question as well: Is the product viable in the market? If not, what can be changed to make it viable? In this respect, we follow the model Marty Cagan recommended in his book <span class="s1"><em>Inspired: How to Build Products Customers Love</em></span>. Build a prototype that users and customers can evaluate; don\'t just show PowerPoint slides. Why? Slides can’t convey an honest experience of any solution. Without a prototype, users and buyers cannot internalize what you are trying to highlight. Humans need to visualize concepts to believe they’re real, and UX helps bring concepts to life through Visualization. Now, this represents just a piece of the total process, so we can highlight how UX can rapidly arrive at the definition for a successful product. For more information about the full process to follow, refer to my article on this site <em>Experience-led: Differentiating on Design</em>, in the section "Step Four: Implement a process that enables you to become experience-led."</p><p> </p><p>Figure 2: Initial Sketch Given to Front-end Developer to Turn Rapidly into Code</p><p><img alt="Example of a Sketch" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5e78aa3b-2341-4b79-be00-a48f15f2a205" src="/images/Sketch.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Figure 3: Code View of the App Built from the Sketch</p><p><img alt="Example of Code Produced Rapidly" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5eaf3d40-5958-444c-8513-19cc2612312d" src="/images/Code-view.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p>Once a prototype has been validated internally, then externally, teams also need to move rapidly to produce a minimum viable product. In my experience, moving rapidly requires a LEAN process, where small groups of highly entrepreneurial designers, engineers, and product managers collocate to execute rapidly. To help the development team move rapidly, prototypes should be—to the extent possible—built in the front-end technology used for the final product, so long as the front-end development team can move fast in creating their prototypes. Once a prototype has been validated, why duplicate effort by building the front-end a second time? </p><p class="p2">Now, the question is, who should build the prototype? If a team wants to move fast with pixel-perfect, production level code, can a UX designer build it? Experience has taught me that designers should not build their own prototypes, for two reasons:</p><ul><li>The UX designer is typically not as skilled at building production-level code, especially with highly interactive screen elements, such as Javascript.</li><li>When both the UX designer and the front-end engineers play their positions, the team moves more than twice as fastas when a designer gets bogged down trying to get their designs to work. </li></ul><p>Here’s the high-level process followed at the UX and Innovation Studio. Note that at the highest level, they follow a user-centered design process, but they also leverage cross-functional input from other teams, incuding Product Management, Engineering, and Customer Experience. The UX Studio team then works together. The UX team crafts an initial visual and interaction design, and the Front-end developers work to implement that in a pixel-perfect format. For subsequent screens, the UX team simply sketches the concepts, and the Front-end Developers produce code rapidly. They work together closely, to ensure the developers capture the design intent and that it overall supports user needs. But, the key point is that they move fast from initial concepts to functional code that they can evaluate with real users and customers.</p><p>Figure 4: UX and Innovation Studio Internal Process</p><p><img alt="Process Followed by UX and Innovation Studio" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="81884d4c-a78c-4dc6-a800-c33682ccfc01" src="/images/Total-FE-Studio-Process.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>However, to ensure the appropriate teamwork between UX designers and front-end developers, they must function as one team and report to one leader. They even need to sit together, so that as soon as the UX designer produces a screen, the FE Developer begins to code it. The designer and FE developer should interact regularly and informally to ensure designs are technically feasible, that they’re pixel perfect, and they have the proper feedback loop to begin moving straight from sketch to code.</p><p>Early in the process, my designers produce highly structured Photoshop assets with layers nested properly, which helps the front-end developer produce an app leveraging exact dimensions, objects, and colors. Once the FE team has built their framework, designers can often just sketch their concepts, and explain them quickly to the FE developer. The FE developer then has enough background to produce the presentation layer code without a high-fidelity mockup.</p><p>In my experience, hiring front-end developers to build prototypes, leveraging these prototypes toward the final presentation layer code, and collocating them with the UX team provides several key benefits:</p><ul><li>Lowers coordination and transaction costs to accelerate development</li><li>Improves your ability to visualize concepts and innovate</li><li>Ensures FE Dev engineers have career progression and are rewarded for highly performant, pixel-perfect code, not machine-to-machine algorithms.</li><li>Ensures design scalability, and increases user productivity and product adoption. </li><li>Optimizing hundreds of interactions and data transactions collaboratively before writing back-end code improves the chances that users will adopt your product for the productivity enhancements it offers at scale.</li></ul><p>It’s important to realize that a front-end developer is not just the most junior member of an engineering team. Although engineers understand and have had training in back-end technologies, most are not trained in the newest front-end technologies. One reason is that front-end technologies change and evolve quickly. But a bigger reason is that engineering organizations reward talent for having expertise in solving deeper, back-end technology problems such as database issues. While the front-end presentation layer presents as many development challenges as the back-end technology, engineers typically seem to think that the human-machine dialogue has less significance than that which occurs between machines. But, in reality, if we expect people to interact with user interfaces that we have not built to optimize every aspect of their experience, our products will fail in the marketplace.</p><p>For a more detailed investigation into this concept, refer to my article <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2012/04/great-user-experiences-require-great-front-end-development.php#sthash.s4hPNtS7.dpuf"><span class="s1"><i>Great User Experiences Require Great Front-End Development</i></span></a> in UX Matters.</p><h2><span style="font-size: 1.143em; font-weight: inherit; line-height: 1.5;">Some Concepts Coded Quickly</span></h2><p >Here are some examples of concepts we moved rapidly from concept to code, so we could solicit input from customers and users:</p><p>Figure 5: In-flight Entertainment Application, Initial Prototype</p><p><img alt="Some concepts coded quickly" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="848f658c-af51-48c1-8f06-0657c60409a3" src="/images/IFE-Black-w-Airplane.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>The UX and Innovation Studio dveloped several protototypes that helped open the sales pipeline.

Of course, then the UX team define workflows and ultimately screens that meet the customer and user\'s unmet and unstated needs, such that they delight their customers and users.As such, UX teams need to be cognizant of that responsibility, and help other teams envision the total experience for their users.This difference defines one major difference between tactical and strategic UX.</p><p>When teams get to the point of designing an application, their wireframes should support the story of a persona moving through a scenario. The scenarios should highlight the experience outcome for the end user. These vignettes, or visual stories, show how users work through an application to complete their tasks. These vignettes should show how we streamline the experience, and promote an emotional connection. To provide visibility with cross-functional stakeholders, I like to hold regular design reviews and include executives in these sessions.</p ><p> At Yahoo!we held weekly Executive UI Review meetings that included our VPs and S - VPs.They also included product managers, engineers, and subject - matter experts, all of whom provided insights on the total experience.These vignettes also enabled the team to see where we could streamline the experience.The real benefit though, was ensuring that UX had a weekly forum that executives supported, where UX presented the vision for the experience.</p><p>At HP, we took this a step farther. We also show vignettes to customers, in two ways: First, we conducted usability studies to understand user performance and one-on-one feedback sessions to gather user preference data and general insights. Second, during user-group meetings, we showed wireframes to highlight the simplified experience the final product would enable. Until this time, product teams had only presented theoretical functionality in PowerPoint slides. Presenting our screens built credibility, because the scenario-based wireframes brought concepts to life.</p ><p> Let’ s take a look at some examples here.</p><h2>Scenario Example</h2><p> In the following scenario, Product Managers and UX worked together to define personas and a realistic experience outcome for this solution.We then defined the scenario in great detail, and then built screens to visualize how we intended to meet the experience outcome.</p><h2>Challenge</h2><p>While airline systems today can identify premium customers, there is very limited functionality to treat these customers differently based on their individual value. Personalization of services and amenities cannot be individualized for a single customer in real time. Our system uses customer profile and valuation to provide personalized service that improves the customer experience.</p><h2>Personas</h2><p>Note that our team defined personas in great detail for each of the following roles. For more information about what attributes to include when defining personas, refer to my article “Innovation Requires Thinking Differently.” This section does not include details on the personas for brevity.</p><h3>Consumer Personas</h3><p>The Brown Family is an average family with three school-aged kids:</p><ul><li>The father, John Brown, is a top level tier member with FlyAway Airlines</li><li>The mother, Lisa, is a home-maker with a part time job</li><li>Anne, who is a 13-year-old daughter</li><li>Steven, who is a 10-year-old son</li><li>Jeffrey, who is an 8-year-old son.</li></ul><p>The Brown family lives 40 miles west of Atlanta, Georgia.</p><h3>Airline Agent Personas</h3><p>This part of the overall solution has three personas: Call-center agents, check-in agents, and gate agents:</p><ul><li>Karen Nichols and Lynette Rogers –Airline call-center agents, who use the system to create bookings.</li><li>Jack Nelson – Airline Check-In Agent</li><li>Sue Smith – Airline Gate Agent</li></ul><h2>Scenario</h2><p>John and Lisa decide to take a family vacation. They have a budget of $2,200 for the flights. They know they wanted a warm destination, and they preferred a flight of no longer than six hours, with no changing planes (which presents a hassle with three kids). They can spend all of the spring school vacation period, but tend to make it between eight and 10 days. The travel dates are flexible within the two-week period. Both John and Lisa find it a hassle to book the whole vacation on the Internet, and they both like personalized service when they can get it. They therefore decide to call the airline directly. By initially searching flights on the Internet, FlyAway Airlines appeared to have the largest number of offers from Atlanta (the closest city to where they live). They have six suitcases, a golf bag and are worried about keeping the kids busy on the plane.</p><h3>The Reservations Application</h3><p>Although this article shows a set of screens, we actually worked hard to define the UX architecture, or Interaction Design (IxD) Model first, to ensure the application held together for all its different users. For more information about defining IxD models, refer to the article “First, Define the UX Architecture—the Interaction Model—for your Apps.” The following wireframes worked to prove out the IxD Model for these applications, and drove refinements. Any IxD Model needs to work in the crucible of the real world.</p><h3>Context: Using Illustrator and Artboards to Create Wireframes</h3><p>After joining this organization, I ended up letting other Interaction Designers move on to other roles, which meant that I was the sole designer on this project for three months, while I was hiring a new team. Other designers preferred to use other tools, such as Axure and Balsamiq, but I prefer to use Adobe Illustrator for wireframing and Photoshop for high-fidelity mockups, because they afford me greater power and flexibility. To create the feel that the user was moving from one real screen to another, I used symbol files for common elements, and established a template for my artboards. Here\'s an example of aset of artboards that I used to include all screens for one complete user flow.</p><p><img alt="Adobe Illustrator Artboards for All Screens Comprising a Complete User Flow" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f334603c-cd1b-4627-a64b-75030acf224e" src="http:/ / cms.designjedi.co ///sites/default/files/inline-images/Artboard.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>In the end, I created more than <em>250 screens</em> across seven primary scenarios. I show only one scenario in this example, because even just this scenario includes almost 60 screens.</p><h2>Vignettes of a new travel booking experience</h2><p>The following scenario and vignettes show how we would support a complex user goal in as simple a manner as possible.</p><h3>Lisa Calls the FlyAway Airlines Call Center</h3><p>In the first part of the scenario, Lisa calls the FlyAway Airlines Call Center and is connected to Karen, an airline call center representative. The caller ID system provides the phone number the call is coming from, which enables the system to pull up the customer profile linked to the phone number (linked to John). With Mr. Brown’s profile in front of Karen, she quickly reviews it. However, she hears a woman’s voice, not a man’s. She therefore asks whom she is speaking with, and learns she is speaking with Mrs. Brown (Lisa). Therefore, Karen clicks John Brown’s name, and gets a dropdown, with all of the family members who are associated with Mr. Brown.</p><p><img alt="Wireframing- Lisa Brown Calls the Reservation Center" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="be6dec2a-0e57-491f-a212-182027645c14" src="/images/WF-1_3.jpg" /></p><p>Karen selects Lisa Brown.</p><p><img alt="Wireframing- Karen selecting Lisa Brown" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="20aab23a-3fa5-46b6-980d-13bebb6adb71" src="/images/WF-2-alt_4.jpg" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>Note that in the Left of the screen, in the area we called the Finding, the system shows the customer, who is of course Lisa.</p><p>Lisa explains the family’s plans.

Great design, which results in experiences users love, increases margins and your competitive advantage. The job of a User Experience leader is to build a UX practice that consistently produces differentiated experiences, that delivers truly inspiring designs that monetize at a much higher rate than the competition. But, many UX teams deliver dreary, complex experiences, even when they at times have budgets in the tens of millions of dollars. Why would an executive pay a premium for such commoditized designs?</p><p> </p><p><img alt="Experience-led companies outperform their competition by 200%" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b0303d4d-674a-4ed1-9c04-4c3ac36ff78d" src="/images/Design-Led-Company-Performance_0.jpg" /></p><h2>Traditional UX Is At a Crossroads</h2><p>Traditional UX is at a crossroads. On one hand, we have design agencies and creative studios producing applications, games, and entertainment that users and audiences love, and which monetize at a high level. On the other, we have far too many companies producing marginal designs. As AG Lafley suggests in his book <em>Play to Win</em>, you should never enter a market or leverage an internal capacity within a company if you do not have a strategy that enables you to win. If a company’s UX capacity is not set up to win, then perhaps CEOs should eliminate their UX capacity and either replace it with less skilled teams or use design agencies to do their design on an ad-hoc basis. Were I in charge and my UX team delivered marginal value, I would either try to turn them around, or eliminate them altogether.</p><p><img alt="Graph showing how experience-led companies outperform their competition by over 200%" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4e8e78bd-17a9-4f45-9600-f4080da93044" src="/images/Design-Led-DMI_0.jpg" /></p><p>Maybe though there is a better question: How do we take UX from average to excellent? The issue is not <em>just </em>about acquiring design skills. Most companies think that if they just hire a great designer, they will differentiate on the experience. Or, they think they can acquire a design agency and their designs will transform the industry. Others think they can just hire a Chief Design Officer or equivalent. I wish it were that easy. I wish companies could take the equivalent of a UX diet pill and get a quick fix.</p><p>Many companies want to change. Many have told me they want to become the Apple or Amazon of their industry. However, they need to recognize that design is not about slapping on a vaneer and hoping it\'s as good as Apple.The company must be the best it can be at what <em>it </em> does. This article highlights the practices companies must engage in to be the best they can be at creating an experience that solves unmet customer needs and makes their product feel indispensable to their customers- just like Apple and Amazon. Such a company must have support at all levels, and treat it like a real transformation. Changing a company so that it can differentiate on the experience requires also changing the culture, and often process and engagement models. I’m sad to say that most companies underestimate what it takes.</p><p> This article highlights some of the key elements required to transform a company into an experience - led organization, so it can outperform its competition by over 200 % .I’ m writing a book on the topic, so will just hit some of the highlights here.For more in -depth information or examples, contact me. </p><h2>What is Great Design?</h2><p> Great design solves real user challenges (even if unexpressed), engages users emotionally, and makes products and services easy to use.It results in experiences that inspire customers through their total journey and creates long - term value.Seldom are delightful experiences based just on a single UI though.They are based on a delightful engagement from beginning to end.A great example is Uber and Lyft or the Samsung Galaxy and the Apple iPhone.In each of these examples, the product is aesthetically pleasing to be sure.It is also much, much more. In the case of Uber and Lyft, the experience is delightful, engaging, and useful. It makes users want to come back. People love it. Many people have started using these services when they had never taken a traditional taxi in the past.</p><p>The Uber and Lyft experience has become so compelling because it is delightful and valuable in a new way that is changing the economics of car ownership. How did Uber and Lyft reach this level of success? They defined an intended experience outcome, and then designed a total experience that is usable, useful, and which creates an emotional engagement. Of course, they have great visual and interaction design. But it’s the total experience and value that represents great design, not just the app, and producing a great total experience requires participation from all of the cross-functional stakeholders. Designing a great experience is not just the job of the designer.</p><p><img alt="Examples of great apps- Uber and Lyft" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1ca744e1-d371-4433-9e06-6bed8a05b39d" src="/images/Uber-Lyft-Combined.png" /></p><p> </p><h2>How to Go from Designing Average to Excellent Experiences</h2><p>Remember, if it were easy to differentiate on the experience, everyone would be doing it. Such differentiation requires what at first may seem like a radical shift, but it seems like this mainly because it requires shifting the way we think about user experience. In fact, every recommendation in this article is being implemented by more than one company transforming itself to become experience-led. This article breaks the process into five basic steps, each with a set of activities that are required to become experience-led, so you differentiate on the design and outperform your competition:</p><ol><li>Get buy-in at all levels to drive a transformation.</li><li>Evolve the culture.</li><li>Implement a process that enables you to become experience-led.</li><li>Take lessons from the best design firms.</li><li>Institute the right organization and engagement model</li></ol><p>This article highlights each of these steps and their and their activities in the sections that follow.</p><h2><strong>1. Get Buy-In for the Transformation</strong></h2><p>Getting buy-in to transform your company to become experience-led requires:</p><ul><li>getting the emotional support of executives, including the CEO</li><li>hiring the right UX leader and a great team.</li></ul><h3>Executives Must be Emotionally Committed to the Transformation</h3><p>All companies that have successfully transformed to become experience-led have a CEO who is emotionally invested in such a transformation. Apple is everyone’s favorite example of a design-led organization, and we’ve all heard much about the relationship between Steve Jobs and Jonathan Ive. As world-class a designer and leader as Jonathan Ive is, before Steve Jobs returned in 1996, design didn’t matter much. As a result, the design team’s work was much less impressive. It’s not that Ive and his team are not in the top 1% of designers. They are. It’s because the team did not have the executive support they needed, and the company did not prioritize design. Companies need at least senior executive support for becoming experience-led and to hire a UX leader who knows how to influence at the executive level.</p><h3>Hire The Right Team</h3><p>There are two steps to getting the right team on board. The first is hiring a UX leader who understands how to, and the second is to hire the most talented team possible, a team that burns hot, and is driven by producing great design.</p><h3>Your UX Leader Must Be a Great Leader in Their Own Right</h3><p>UX practitioners in particular are motivated by purpose: The knowledge they are creating something that makes a difference to people. On the other hand, corporations are driven by profit. Great UX leaders tie purpose to profits with an inspiring vision. Such a vision captures the head and the heart of both employees and senior leadership. It helps attract and retain the most talented researchers and designers in the industry. Such great UX leaders also know how to inspire and engage these employees to produce truly stellar designs that impress company leadership, and fulfill a deeper purpose for the designers themselves. They build trust, and help their employees do the best work of their careers.</p><p>A great UX leader also understands what it takes to transform a company into a design - led organization.They know how toset up an organizational structure and inspire a culture that can attract the best talent, that lets designers do what they do best, and incorporates design thinking strategically into the organization.Such leaders also understand the language of business, and can communicate from this business framework.They also produce a vision that instills a deeper sense of purpose that connects to the values that designers hold: Designers want to make the world a better place and improve the human experience.A great leader knows how to tie corporate purpose to value and purpose that makes the best designers want to participate.</p><p>At the same time, great UX leaders are also be brutally honest with themselves. We see some UX leaders who declare success once they’re a Senior VP or Chief Design Officer, even if their designs are still average. The best UX leaders know that success is a function of transformative experiences that differentiate the company. It is not about their headcount, or even their title. They focus on building the right culture, evolving processes, and drive design thinking strategically. They enable the whole organization to contribute to producing inspiring results, not just the UX team.</p><h3>Hire Only the Most Skilled Resources </h3><p>Every UX leader—indeed leaders in all disciplines—agree on the surface that they need to hire only top talent. The challenge is that most corporate UX leaders end up compromising that objective. Sure, they hire talented individuals. But, they cannot hire the best. Part of the issue is that the most talented UX professionals seek not only skilled UX leaders, but also a company culture and processes that enable them to produce experiences that inspire pride. Unfortunately, most organizational structures and company cultures are not set up to facilitate inspiring design. As a result, the most talented leave. Where do they go? They leave for a design agency, or one of the very few in-house UX teams that can produce agency-quality experiences.</p><p> How then do corporations attract the best talent ? It starts with having support from senior leadership.It also requires hiring a UX leader who can take advantage of this support, attract the best creative directors, form the right organizational structure and processes, and establish a vision that inspires teams to want to be a part of something great.And then, it requires execution and great results.</p><p>As Daniel Pink highlights in his book <em> Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,</em> the best employees are rewarded less by external factors, such as salary levels. The following two images are from the RSA Animate video with the same name:</p><p></p><p><img alt="Salary only motivates in that people must be paid enough" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3aa98af2-388d-4425-832a-428a335e7018" src="/images/Salary-off-Table.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>The fact is that leaders have to pay people enough to take money off the table as an issue, but it neither attracts nor retains the best employees. The best employees are motivated by the certainty they are creating something that makes a difference to the people who use it, that they are producing experiences that people connect with. And that\'s the issue: A great leader crafts an exciting and authentic vision that gives people a deeper sense of purpose, that resonates with their internal values, and enables them to execute at their highest levels.They give their employees autonomy.And, as great leaders, they hire exceptional talent, so employees know that they will become better, or gain mastery.</p><p> </p><p> <img alt="Employees are motivated by purpose, autonomy, and mastery" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="33b7f4fa-3b82-4ec8-8a63-999d8ffd5ed3" src="/images/AutonomyMasteryPurpose_0.png" class="align-left" /></p><p> </p><p>The environment and support that enables leaders to acquire top talent and then to produce world-class designs creates a virtuous cycle that excites executives, design teams, adjacent disciplines. It results in truly differentiated experiences that delight users!</p><h2><strong>2. Evolve the Company Culture</strong></h2><p>The fact is that changing a culture is at the heart of any change. It\'s foundational: Of the companies that have become experience - led, all have evolved their culture to support radical collaboration.Behavior < span > results from internal motivations that are expressed. Because behaviors are expressed based on internal goals and motivations, so</span> change must start from the inside. If you want others to change, you must give them a reason that resonates with their values and motivates them to change. Everything about becoming experience-led is about creating and sustaining value.</p><p>Therefore, any company and any individual must start by analying and clarifying their own values and then pursue goals that align to those values with passion. Values drive passion, and this passion must be expressed in the leader and company\'s objectives.More than this, they must be values the rest of the organization canget behind.If you want people to take action on a transformation, leadership must communicate authentically its values, and how they will reinforce those values in culture.The fact is that changing culture is difficult, and most companies fail trying to do so.When leadership tries to change culture from the outside, it does not resonate with employees, and they ignore the request as just another ephemeral initiative.Any extrinsic motivation cannot override a person\'s self - motivations and values.But, when a leader holds aset of values, communicates those values as immutable, and these values and vision resonate with deeply - held beliefs of employees, then and only then will employees begin behaving differently.Yes, people— especially people at work— are often self - motivated and hold cynicism toward any change.These intrinsic motivations that employees do not express represent the hurdle leadership must jump over.How do you get employees to optimize not for themselves, but for the larger team and organization ? They have to believe and they have to care.It is the job of a leader to establish values, a vision, and practices that resonate and support the culture that they want.</p><p>What kind of culture is required to transform a company to become expeience-led? One that leverages integrative thinking and multidisciplinary collaboration at the deepest levels. One that embraces and requires both candor and deep, vulnerability-based trust. Only companies that get the best minds and hearts in the game get products that transform their markets. They transform markets because they create sustainable long-term value that nobody previously imagined. To achieve this though, e<span >mployees must begin optimizing for the organization\'s success, not their own, and the only way to do that is to connect with an employee\'s sense of purpose. </span>We talk about how practices or processes must be aligned to culture later in the section "Implement a Process that Helps You Become Experience-led." Culture starts with values, and is supported by these practices.</span ></p><p>The right culture is one of radical collaboration, where teams work hard to define creative outcomes that inspire them and their customers. But reinforcing a culture also requires that executives (and employees at all levels) within a company: </p><ul><li>treat becoming experience-led like they would any transformation, that they recognize that it takes intensive effort every day</li><li>communicate the urgency of embracing new practices</li><li>establish and adhere to a compelling vision</li><li> instill Integrative Thinking through the organization </li><li>establish rewards for teamwork, collaboration, and joint decision making</li><li>embrace candor and failure</li><li>implement a transformation communication cycle</li><li>show wins through an Experience Matters program</li><li>establish education in design thinking (but not a codified process).</li></ul><p>As highlighted earlier, just acquiring a design firm or hiring a great designer does not convert companies into experience-led enterprises. If the company culture does not change in a way that supports an optimal user and customer experience, any change to becoming experience-led lasts only a short time. Of course, processes and organizational structures must also change, but before people will follow a new process, they must recognize the value of such change, that they must be part of it, and then recognize the different practices and behaviors they must live.</p><h2><strong>3. Implement a process that helps you become experience-led</strong></h2><p >For any company to transform itself at all, especially to become experience-led, it must align its practices to its culture and values so teams can embody them in its day-to-day approach to product or service development and evolution. If an organization has the necessary support and is working to implement the right culture, the<span > following leading industry practices can help</span> companies differentiate on the experience:</p><ul ><li>Start by defining experience outcomes upfront, then features and technologies</li><li>Fail Fast: Go Rapidly from Concept to Code</li><li>Implement a Two-step Process: Plan then Execute</li><li>Implement a Multidisciplinary Decision Making Framework</li><li>Focus on the Total Customer Journey, Not Just a Single App</li><li>Discover Emotional Drivers through Lean Ethnography</li></ul><h3>Start by Defining Experience Outcomes, Then Features and Technologies</h3><p >Being experience-led means literally that you start with the experience. Companies that differentiate on the experience today do not start by defining feature sets. They first define a vision for the experience outcome they intend for their users and customers. Only then do they define features and technologies to support this vision. This said, it is important to understand the process more deeply. Crafting an Experience Outcome does not mean that teams cannot improve the concept. Rather, they understand the ultimate experience they are shooting for. During iterations (sprints), the team might improve on the original experience outcome. But, they can never "dumb it down." If a team defined an experience outcome as "enable users to tap their screen one time to listen to voice mail messages," then they would never go back to the old method of dialing, entering a password, waiting 45 seconds, listening to messages in sequence, then interacting with each message. If they could improve on the vision of "visual voicemail," they would identify those improvements during sprints.</p><h3>Go Rapidly from Concept to Code</h3><p >Teams must learn to fail fast, and this must become an accepted cultural norm. In the design field, that means going from concept to code rapidly and iterating on the early concept. As mentioned earlier, Eric Ries suggests in <em>The Lean Startup</em> that companies succeeding in the Internet age are those that pivot the fastest to changing market demands. UX teams are no different. We have to research and build concepts fast, solicit feedback, and iterate, all within the Product Planning phase. The real objective is to fail as fast as we can, and then learn from our failures. Remember—failure is not bad. It’s good to stretch ourselves, to fail, and learn.</p><p ><img alt="Decrease learning time by going from concept to code" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="160cedd2-a7fa-475c-b01e-302024fdda48" src="/images/Concept-to-Code_0.jpg" /></p><p > </p><h3>Engage a Process that Facilitates Great Design—Plan then Execute</h3><p >In the Concept to Code model, companies know they are building the right solution, because they have verified it in their marketplace. As they evolve even farther, they move to an even more cutting-edge, but deeply practical model: The Double-Diamond Framework. Before we talk about Double-diamond, let\'s talk about how most companies do it. </p><p >In experience-led companies, designers help visualize the end experience through prototypes with which the product team and users can interact. They then gather market-based feedback and user feedback (both performance-based and preference-based measures). Visionary companies and design leaders today do just that: They engage in a more detailed planning cycle before entering project execution—before the build cycle. While many companies have implemented planning before execution, the UK Design Council first codified this process as the Double-diamond approach, in a way that supports transformative experiences. In the following diagram, the first diamond represents planning phase, where teams <em>define</em> the right thing to build, and verify that.The second diamond is the Execution Phase, where teams <em> build </em> the right thing. </p>  <img alt= "The Double Diamond Process of Defining, then Executing" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="131b9e88-b4db-4514-8850-803eaec45c1a" src="/images/Double-Diamond-Dev-Process-stacked.jpg" class="align-center" /><p>In the Definition phase, teams define strategy, including an experience outcome, engage in early design, craft prototypes, and evaluate their concepts in the market. Only after they have validated their concept do they move into Execution phase. It’s almost too simple really. In his book <em>Inspired: How to Create Products Customers Love, </em>Marty Cagan, points out that before you decide to build a product, you need to create a prototype. Then, get it in front of customers, and see if it’s what they need and will buy. Based on customer feedback, the product team then iterates the solution and incorporates it into the final plan of what will get built. The Double Diamond approach ensures teams have inspiring products that customers love!</p><h3>Institute Multidisciplinary Decision Making Frameworks—The Triad</h3><p >Experience-led companies that exceed the financial performance of their competition also leverage UX at a strategic level. Marty Cagan also points out in <em>Inspired </em>that to build products customers love, Engineering, Product Management, and User Experience need to engage in a joint decision making framework. Other teams contribute at different points, but differentiating on the experience requires including only these three groups in decision making around product direction. Product managers must be held to the standards of the intended experience outcome, which must be a decision made at the outset of a product’s development. This requires the User Experience team to participate, to help advocate for the experience, and then to help visualize the aligned vision.</p><p ><img alt="Multidisciplinary decision making framework" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2c34e759-9e3b-4768-8a00-c85f8b1189e0" src="/images/Cube-600px.png" /></p><p >On the other hand, executives often say they want one person accountable for the product. This is fine. However, being experience-led means that once teams have defined an experience outcome, they stick with it. From a Product Management standpoint, they agree to only release those capabilities that meet the intended experience and push others out. In most companies, they would compromise the experience on individual features to get more out the door. People frequently ask how Apple releases such great products. Let’s take an example: When the iPhone first released, SMS (texting) was not the great experience initially defined. So, they shipped the first iPhone without SMS, and added it later, once the capability met the experience outcome. Internally, some product managers said the iPhone would fail without SMS. They were wrong: Getting SMS right was critical. Customers loved the initial iPhone, and loved it when Apple added SMS in a way that delighted them.</p><p >In experience-led companies, UX has a strategic voice as part of the triad, just as engineering and product management do.</p><h3>Focus on the Total Customer Journey, not Just a Single UI</h3><p >Focusing on the total customer and user experience across the total customer journey is crucial to driving significant financial return. Typically though, in-house corporate UX teams are asked to <em>just</em> design a single application. In reality, the UI is just one touch point into the total experience a user or customer has with your company. The Total UX includes every touch point. It includes a user’s first introduction to the company through marketing materials or a friend, their first and subsequent visits to the corporate web site, evaluating or trying out the product or service, the purchase process, first-time use, ongoing use, service and support, the upgrade process, and so on. When UX teams focus on just one aspect of the App , and another team focuses on another part of the App, and yet another team focuses on the marketing, it often creates a confusing and inconsistent experience. Why would we want the marketing message to differ from the actual product? Why would we want to make it easy to use a product, but make it difficult to decide which product to purchase? If a customer solution comprises several components, why would we make some components easy, and not others?</p><p >Forrester conducted research in mid 2014 highlighting that customer journey maps are among the hottest new artifacts, and that a majority of CEOs find them extremely useful. Their main value comes from the fact that they help knock down silos across their companies. A Customer Journey Map highlights all the different touch points a user has with a brand, from acquisition through purchase, usage, and support. They enable executives to bring teams together who would typically never work together to jointly solve problems for the customer. </p><h3>Discover Emotional Triggers through Lean Ethnography</h3><p >Great design leaders recognize that they need user researchers who can draw on the framework of Lean processes and rapid contextual research to engage in Lean Ethnography. During the Planning phase, such researchers rapidly identify not just unmet user needs, but also find the key emotional connectors to a product or service. They ensure the product is intuitive, satisfying, and delightful, not unlike the Uber and Lyft examples earlier.</p><p ><img alt="Logical-emotional design paradigm" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dfe6598e-186b-4a72-b000-e76731bb9f16" src="/images/Logical-Emotional-Paradigm.jpg" width="1200" /></p><p >I call this model my Logical-Emotional Experience Paradigm. In this model, researchers and designers understand how to create engaging experiences. These experiences touch the irrational, emotional side of people, which affects behavior. At the same time, they support users in completing real objectives efficiently.</p><h2><strong>4. Take Lessons from Creative Studios</strong></h2><div>Companies reinventing themselves around the experience (typically digital and industrial design) today are taking core lessons from design firms and creative agencies. Recently, dozens of large companies from Facebook and Google to Accenture and PwC, have spent Billions of dollars to acquire design agencies to reinvent themselves as experience-led. But, because they are not changing from the inside-out, most of these companies will not successfully reinvent themselves as experience-led. Other companies re-orienting themselves to become experience-led, including IBM, Honeywell, and Visa, are implementing the most valuable practices from design studios internally within their companies.</div><p><img alt="Rapid design lab in progress" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5b7869aa-7b8d-4838-b900-0018a7615e7f" src="/images/RapidDesignLabs.png" /></p><p>On the other hand, many UX leaders within corporations suggest design agencies care more about their portfolios than the quality of real deliverables. They are right—in some cases—but not all. These UX leaders have an opportunity to understand best practices, and leave limiting practices from poor agencies behind:</p><ul><li><strong>Leverage a complete design team</strong>, not single designers who’s voices get lost in a project team of dozens of members.</li><li><strong>Hire brilliant creative directors</strong>, who excel in the art of facilitation and constructive criticism. Great creative directors<span > stimulate creative dialog, so that everybody contributes </span>and articulates the underlying problem they are trying to solve with their idea. They never shut down dialog or bring an attitude that they must protect the group from bad ideas. Such creative directors simply have a wealth of creative successes that enable them to inspire and lead design efforts where the best ideas can be born and thrive.</li><li><strong>Build physical design studios</strong>. All companies undergoing a transformation to become experience-led build such studios. They facilitate concentrated creativity and focus on core design objectives, which raises the level of usability and delight of resulting products.</li><li><strong>Always produce inspiring designs</strong>—never compromise on the quality of output. If teams need something done too fast, help them find someone else who can help.</li><li><strong>Conduct collaboration workshops</strong>. We choose to facilitate Rapid Design Labs, which bring a collaborative and cross-functional approach to design and innovation that aligns organizations around a powerful vision rapidly. They foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. In these labs, cross-functional teams of designers, researchers, product managers, engineers, marketing, sales, and other key organizations work together to solve major business challenges. They engage in intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping, which foster trust and teamwork better than any HR offsite can.</li><li><strong>Create a strategic ecosystem of industry partnerships.</strong> They not only augment a team’s resources, but infuse creativity and challenge the internal team to greater heights and the most modern design trends.</li></ul><p> </p><p><img alt="Design firms leverage focus teams" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f76abc59-2144-43ea-ad06-06d3f4099bc1" src="/images/Focus-Teams-shorter.png" /></p><p> </p><h2><strong>5. Institute the Right Organization and Engagement Model</strong></h2><h3>Organizational Structure—Studio, BU Partnership</h3><p>All of the traditional UX organizational models brings challenges that cause companies to reorganize their UX capability numerous times over a series of years. My Studio, BU Partnership solves the challenges seen in other organizational models prevalent today.</p><p>I call this model the Centralized Studio, Business Unit Partnership model. Numerous companies, including IBM, GE, Honeywell, Visa, Airbnb, and more are leveraging this model, and Groupon has implemented a similar model. These companies recognize the need to invoke a central UX team in their UX studio, and that they must also have at least one responsible UX presence in each business unit. The studios create the space for creativity and collaboration that drives differentiated experiences. At the same time, members of the UX team in the business unit understand and align with business objectives and challenges, advocate for the needs of the business, and identify funding required by the business unit. Members of the UX team within the business unit are accountable to the success of UX initiatives and are measured against this success or failure.</p><h3>Include Front-end development In the UX Studio</h3><p>In practice, if a front-end development team sits with the design team and works collaboratively on the presentation-layer code, it can save up to 50% of the total time to build a presentation layer. Here’s how it works: The design team produces a set of screens and UI specifications to help the front-end development team understand the exact colors, fonts, colors, shading, padding, types of controls and gestures, and to ensure elements fit on the page in a pixel-perfect representation of the design. After producing a limited subset of UI specs, designers can produce and hand over no more than sketches.</p><p><img alt="Including the Front-end team in the UX Studio" src="/images/Total-FE-Studio-Process_0.png" /></p><p>If they work directly with front-end developers who are highly skilled translating designs into reality, these developers have the ability to take sketches and (with a few pages in place) produce pixel-perfect front-end code. From the perspective of speed, it helps significantly compress schedules. UX Designers and FE Developers must work together in person and informally, create high-quality visualizations fast, and iterate them fast. One team cannot throw designs over the fence to another group and have them build it with pixel perfection and make all of the gestures smooth. Speed and quality requires they be collocated, at least during the design phase of the project, so they can function as a single unit.</p><p>Front-end developers in companies that currently differentiate on the experience feel a deep need to constantly optimize the experience using the latest technologies. They fall more into the design camp than the development camp. Of course, the task of connecting the presentation layer to business logic and services, and then to the back-end, belongs to developers who sit in the Engineering organization.</p><p>The problem is that when FE Dev teams sit inside Engineering, their credibility in these organizations depend on growing skills in back-end technologies. They are rewarded for the wrong behavior: They spend less time evolving their knowledge of front-end technologies—their supposed focus—which change much more rapidly than back-end technologies anyhow.</p><p>More than this, UX teams need the technical skills of a front-end development team to work closely with the designers, to provide insights on what is possible currently, and what would be possible if we pushed technological boundaries. This helps both improve individual designs and make them more likely to succeed technically. It also helps the designers to become better at predicting what will be buildable, and what ideas they should abandon in favor of alternate strategies.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Most executives if asked would say they want to differentiate, yet when it comes to differentiating on the experience, few understand what it takes. Many executives think they can acquire a design firm and they\'ll have great design throughout the company.Unfortunately, that is like wanting to lose weight, but not being willing to change one\'s diet or exercise.Transforming a company to become experience - led takes dedication, focus, and investment, just as it does to differentiate on technology or any other area of business.Once a CEO and executive staff provide the support, they need a UX leader who knows how to inspire executives, their team, and customers.Leaders who can engage emotionally as well as logically can help facilitate a transformation that gives the company a competitive advantage and delights its customers.
